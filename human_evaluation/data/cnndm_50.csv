"The Pentagon said Tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and Marines killed when the USS Oklahoma sank in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ship capsized after being hit by nine torpedoes during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack from Japanese forces. Altogether, 429 sailors and Marines onboard were killed. Only 35 were identified in the years immediately after. Hundreds were buried as unknowns at cemeteries in Hawaii. In 1950, they were reburied as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific - also known as the Punchbowl - inside a volcanic crater in Honolulu. Scroll down for video . Casualties: The Pentagon announced Tuesday plans to exhume the bodies of some 400 sailors and Marines who were killed on the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, in the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor. Above, the ship seen capsized after the attack . Resting place: The sailors and Marines who died on board the USS Oklahoma are currently buried as unknowns in Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific . Nameless: Above, a gravestone at Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, marking the resting place of seven unknown Americans who died on board the USS Oklahoma . The military is acting now, nearly 75 years after the men died, because advances in forensic science and technology as well as genealogical help from family members have made it possible to identify more remains, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency spokeswoman. The move is apparently a part of a new Pentagon policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops. According to the new policy, bodies may be exhumed from Punchbowl or any other permanent American military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any U.S. Navy vessel that is being used as a national memorial, like the USS Arizona which remains sunk and on display in Honolulu. The bodies of Marines and sailors lost at sea do not apply to this new effort. In order to disinter these large groups, researchers must also prove that they can identify at least 60 per cent of the group with supplied family DNA samples, medical and dental records. 'The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care,' Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement.

"Chelsea will announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan on Wednesday in a move that will come as a significant blow to Manchester City. The dazzling attacking midfielder, who turned 19 last month, has been in London for talks with the Blues this week and passed a medical on Tuesday. Nathan is seen as the next big thing in South American football and touches down in the capital with an ever-growing reputation. Chelsea will announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan on Wednesday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has beaten Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini to the signing of the Brazilian . Premier League champions City had hoped to tie up a deal after first spotting the player at the World Under 17 Championships two years ago. He has since broken into the Atletico Paranaense team but a serious contract dispute with the Brazilian side meant Chelsea were able to swoop. Nathan joins the already strong Brazilian contingent at Chelsea, moving alongside Willian, Ramires, Filipe Luis and Oscar. The staggering potential of Nathan, who can also play as a secondary striker, means he could feature in Jose Mourinho’s first team next season. Nathan will join fellow Brazilians Willian, Ramires, Filipe Luis and Oscar (pictured) at Stamford Bridge .","The 19-year-old was spotted by Atletico Paranaense at the World Under 17 Championships two years ago .

"Ronan Ghosh, 39, stole £200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco store in Birmingham, court heard . A millionaire company director was caught on CCTV shoplifting £200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco supermarket. Ronan Ghosh, 39, was filmed attempting to smuggle the goods out of the store in a bag after paying for other items at the checkout. The company boss heads a global recycling company with a turnover of £16million, lives in a £500,000 home in an exclusive neighbourhood and runs two BMWs. But a court heard that he was caught shoplifting after heading to a Tesco store following an argument with his girlfriend. His own barrister told the judge the offence ‘beggars belief’. Ghosh initially elected trial by jury but he then pleaded guilty to theft. Judge Murray Creed imposed a 12-month community order on Ghosh and told him to complete 80 hours’ unpaid work and pay £575 costs. Birmingham Crown Court heard on Tuesday that Ghosh visited the Tesco store in Stratford Road, south Birmingham, on February 21 and was captured on its security cameras selecting items, including meat and bottles of wine, which he put into a bag. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said he then went to the checkout and paid for shopping that was in his trolley, but not for what was in the bag. Ghosh was detained by a security guard and police were called. In 2009, the businessman set up RG Recycling – based in Solihull, West Midlands – after more than a decade working in the plant and recycling industry. Charnjit Jutla, defending, told the court the firm supplies ‘high-value machinery for the recycling industry’. He added: ‘It is a global business. It has a yearly turnover of £16million. It beggars belief as to why he finds himself in this court. He accepts full responsibility for what he has done.’ Mr Jutla said Ghosh, who lives in a tree-lined road in Solihull, was ‘disappointed with himself and shocked and embarrassed’. On the day of the theft, his father had told him his mother had been diagnosed with skin cancer and that had ‘worried him a lot’. Mr Jutla said there was also a will being discussed within the family which had put considerable strain on him. Ghosh told police he had visited the Tesco store after having an argument with his girlfriend. He claimed he had not intended to steal the goods. Ghosh, who lives in a luxury £550,000 house in leafy Solihull, initially elected trial by jury at Birmingham Crown Court but then pleaded guilty to theft.

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property","London's Farm Street was once a hub of agricultural trade .

"(CNN)Pop star Taylor Swift, who has built an intense bond with her fans by sharing personal details of her life, revealed some sobering news Thursday: Her mother has cancer. The singer did not divulge the nature or severity of the cancer, saying I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private. Andrea Swift, 57, who years ago quit her job as a mutual fund marketing executive to raise Swift and Swift's younger brother, Austin, has joined her famous daughter on tour and in several of her videos. In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, just to ease some worries of mine. Her mother felt perfectly fine but went to the doctor for tests anyway just to get me and my brother off her case about it. The results came in, and I'm saddened to tell you that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know, Swift added. #PrayForMamaSwift was a trending hashtag Thursday on Twitter, where Swift's legions of fans offered prayers and messages of support. Within an hour and a half, Swift's tweet about her mom had been retweeted more than 21,000 times. Many fans shared there's something in your eyes that says we can beat this, a lyric from Swift's 2008 song Change. Swift also urged her fans to make sure their parents get screened for cancer and other potential health problems. She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they've got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle ... she wrote. Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about. Swift, 25, added that usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now. Thank you for caring about my family so much that she would want me to share this information with you.

"(CNN)Since the headline-grabbing murder of American journalist James Foley by ISIS militants eight months ago, the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient, primally horrifying method of execution. British and American aid workers, Japanese and American journalists, Kurdish and Syrian soldiers and Egyptian and now Ethiopian Christians were among those who followed in Foley's wake: their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience. These highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the ISIS cause. But beyond this, some experts such as psychology professor Arie W. Kruglanski suggest, the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knock-on effect. He says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copy-cat acts or threats of decapitation -- not only from Islamists, but from the disbelievers they target. Kruglanski, distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, says the frequent, high profile reports of ISIS beheadings could result in psychologically priming people to be more inclined to emulate them, or threaten to, during moments of conflict or extreme stress. Because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally, the very concept of beheading, that was virtually non-existent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated, is now there, he told CNN. It comes to mind when a conflict happens, when you react aggressively, he said. It sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high, and result in actual behavior. Reports of beheadings also emerge from Saudi Arabia, where it is a legal method of execution under the country's judicial code; and Mexico and Brazil, where it is typically the work of criminal gangs. But neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as ISIS's propaganda, in which the threat is extended to disbelievers around the globe. A similar copy-cat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings, said Kruglanski. Once the idea is planted then when someone is upset, feeling violent, the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind, because it's sitting there in our unconscious, he said. A lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by non","ISIS beheadings have galvanized international opposition to group .

"Known locally as Millionaires’ Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for £4million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties – Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives – that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of £4 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg’s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub.

"A senior Labour MP has admitted that the party would look to 'forge a common alliance' with the SNP to ensure Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister. David Lammy, who is standing for London Mayor, said the SNP was a party Labour could 'do business with' in the event of another hung Parliament. The admission comes amid increasingly stark warnings from the Tories that the SNP will hold Labour to 'ransom' if it holds the balance of power in Parliament next month. Scroll down for video . David Lammy, appearing on ITV News last night, said the SNP was a party Labour could 'do business with' in the event of another hung Parliament . Polls suggest Nicola Sturgeon's party are on course to win up to 50 seats on May 7 – wiping out any hopes of a Labour majority. But the Scottish First Minister has vowed to work with Mr Miliband to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 in exchange for higher government spending, more taxes and increased borrowing. Former prime minister John Major will today warn that Britain faces a 'daily dose of blackmail' from the SNP if they have the power to bring down a Labour government. With 16 days to polling on May 7, Sir John will say that a Labour-SNP administration would lead to 'weak and unstable' government and wreck Britain's economic recovery. Mr Miliband has ruled out joining a formal coalition with the SNP but has refused to be drawn on whether he could work with them on a vote-by-vote basis. However, speaking on ITV News last night, Mr Lammy went further – insisting that a deal with the SNP could be struck. Mr Miliband meanwhile has accused the Prime Minister of 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' by talking up the prospects of Scottish nationalists in the May 7 General Election . Speaking on Newsnight last night Mr Miliband insisted he would not form a Coalition with the SNP after the election . He said: 'We are fighting for a victory. I think we can win this election. But clearly, after the general election, you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with, and the SNP must be part of that story.'

"Britain's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a £1million Constable masterpiece that was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War. Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting – Beaching A Boat, Brighton – was legitimately brought to Britain. The 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from Budapest to Zurich, including one by Constable identified as Fishing Boat. Scroll down for video . New evidence? Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to Britain . Constable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War . The discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting’s original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958. The descendants of Hatvany – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary. It turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986. The family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a ‘moral obligation’ to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate’s claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive. The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported. Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured) Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn’t change anything as it does not identify Hatvany. One source said: ‘If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.’ A source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by","Britain's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a £1million Constable masterpiece .

"A council has been slammed for ripping up more than 12,000 cobbles from a historic road so it can relay them to make it a smoother surface for cyclists. Cobbles on the road, which runs alongside the Bristol Floating Harbour and dates back to the 19th century, will be lifted from their current place and cut in half before being relaid again. The council tested the technique on a small patch of paving and said the reaction had been 'overwhelmingly' in support for the scheme from cyclists, pedestrians and wheelchair users. The cobbles will be lifted from their current place, cut in half and then relaid again to make the surface smoother for cyclists . The history of the area dates back to May 1809 when 83 acres of the tidal River Avon was impounded to keep ships in the port of Bristol afloat at all times. Maggie Shapland, a member of the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society, has questioned what the work will do to the appearance of the historic harbourside. She said: '12,000 cobbles have been lifted. They are being cut in half and re-laid so that there is a flat surface. The history of the area dates back to the 19th century when Bristol Floating Harbour was built . 'It has apparently been requested by the cyclists despite the fact that it is a harbourside walk and not a designated cyclist route. 'This is a massive job, must have cost a fortune since the cobbles are hard to cut and will totally change the appearance of the area.' The work is part of the council's and the Cycling Ambition Fund's overall vision of making the city more attractive for users.

"This is the dramatic moment a golden retriever had to be rescued from the water after being swept half a mile out to sea while playing on the shoreline.

"Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's Manchester derby. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. Manager Louis van Gaal said last week he did not expect the striker to be fit enough to return for Sunday's game against Manchester City at Old Trafford, but Van Persie reported good news for United fans on Wednesday. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games . Louis van Gaal will be pleased to have Van Persie back but he is unlikely to start the game . The 31-year-old tweeted: 'Back to training with the group today. Was a great session. Happy to be fit and able to play again. Looking forward to my next game!' Even if Van Gaal considers Van Persie to be fit to take part in the derby, it is hard to see how the former Arsenal front man would fit into the starting XI. United have hardly missed the Dutchman, who has scored just 10 goals this term. During his absence, the Red Devils have only lost once - against his former employers Arsenal in the FA Cup. United have recorded creditable victories over Tottenham and Liverpool and last Saturday they moved above City into third with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. Wayne Rooney scored a stunning volley during the win. The United skipper has performed well up front in a 4-3-3 formation alongside Ashley Young and Juan Mata, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win at Anfield two-and-a-half weeks ago. Marouane Fellaini has also provided able and robust support from midfield. Wayne Rooney celebrates with Radamel Falcao after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend . Victory for United this weekend would pile more misery on out-of-form City and improve Van Gaal's chances of achieving his target of Champions League qualification. Once he returns from his summer break, he is likely to take United on a shortened pre-season tour, with the most likely destination the United States, it has emerged. Van Gaal made no secret of his annoyance at United's pre-season schedule last summer. United had already committed themselves to a three-week long tour that took in five matches across five American cities by the time Van Gaal took over as manager. United travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip, which included games in Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Washington DC and Miami - all against high-profile opposition. This summer's tour is expected to see United take on fewer opponents","Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's Manchester derby .

"Dead fish have continued to wash up on the banks of a Rio de Janeiro lake that is scheduled to hold Olympic rowing competitions during the 2016 games. Fish die-offs are a frequent occurrence in Rio's waterways, which are choked with raw sewage and rubbish. The latest incident, affecting thousands of small silvery fish called twaite shad, began several days ago at the Rodrigo de Freitas lake, where the Olympic canoeing and rowing events are to be held. The Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon will hold the Brazil 2016 Olympics rowing and canoe competitions . Currently, the lake is littered with thousands of dead fish due to the raw sewage and rubbish within it . With neighbors complaining about the stench, employees of the city's waste management company have been working to clear away the dead fish. 'Every year there are these die-offs, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller,' said photographer Alex Moutinho, who has lived near the lake for over three decades. 'It's one more Brazilian shame.' In a statement, the city's environmental secretariat said the latest incident was the result of recent rains and high sea levels, which caused the lake's water temperature to plummet. The statement stressed that twaite shad are sensitive to variations in temperature, adding that oxygen levels in the lake were normal. Officials say the recent problems are the result of rain, which caused the lake's temperature to plummet . The city's waste management company have been brought in to clear the lake of the dead fish . Vultures feed on the dead fish on the shore of the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon in Rio de Janeiro on Monday . Previous fish die-offs in the lake have been blamed on pollution-related drops in oxygen levels. The cause of February die-off of twaite shad in the Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held, were not known. Rio's water quality has become a contentious topic ahead of the 2016 Olympics. Authorities had pledged to clean up some of the waterways including the Guanabara Bay ahead of the games but now admit those promises won't be met, sparking sailors to voice worries about possible health and safety threats posed by competing in the sewage and garbage-filled waters. Residents concerned about the water quality of a canal in the Rio neighborhood of Recreio staged a protest on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators linked arms along the Canal das Taxas, which is filled with raw sewage from nearby condominiums.

"For the last few years the self-styled biggest club in the world, Manchester United, have not even appeared the biggest club on their home patch. The ‘noisy neighbours’ of Manchester City have spent more and won more. And the Sir Alex Ferguson factor vanished from Old Trafford when he retired in 2013. In fact the last time United won a derby at home was in 2011 when Wayne Rooney’s late spectacular acrobatic goal earned them a 2-1 victory. Wayne Rooney scored a spectacular overhead kick as Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-1 in 2011 . United sit above City in the Premier League table for the first time in 16 months after having played the same amount of matches - following the latest round of results . Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on April 4 . Meanwhile City players look crestfallen during their 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Easter Monday night . But there has been a sudden and surprising shift this season. United have forced their way above City in the Premier League table for the first time since November 2013, and should Louis van Gaal’s red-hot team beat their suddenly-fragile rivals on Sunday afternoon, they will move four points clear of the defending champions. For many, then, the natural balance of power will have been restored. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is no longer trying to hide the collapse of his side’s season, which has seen them slip to fourth and make an early exit from three cup competitions, including the coveted Champions League. Having defended his side earlier following losses at Burnley and Crystal Palace, the Chilean has decided to be more candid ahead of the derby. ‘It has not been a good season, definitely not a good season,’ he said. ‘It was not so bad until the end of 2014, we were top of the table and still in the Champions League. But in the last three months, we have thrown it into the garbage, all that we did earlier. We are doing some things very badly, that’s why we must improve.’ Admitting there is a problem is always the first step to recovery but Pellegrini, who has won his last three games against United, appears a little less sure about how to fix it.

"A former TV pitchman in Utah known for his over-the-top personality pleaded guilty to harassing a barn owl in flight while on a motorized paraglider. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, 45, was sentenced to one year of probation on Friday after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. His admission of guilt follows a plea deal that fell through on Thursday after he refused to admit to the 2011 crime which he said makes him look like an evil, horrible person. However, he returned to a federal court on Friday to plead guilty. Schanze was scheduled to go to trial on April 20 and would have faced a maximum of one year in federal prison and more than $100,000 in fines if convicted. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze arrives for a court appearance at the federal courthouse on Thursday, April 9, 2015 in Salt Lake City where a plea deal fell through because he refused to admit to the 2011 crime. On Friday, he returned to the court to plead guilty . On Friday, Schanze pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird . 'There was no plea agreement, and federal prosecutors made no concessions to Schanze as a part of his guilty plea to both counts,' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office, KSL reported. The charges, filed in October 2014, came after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online in 2013. It appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it. In a statement released from the attorney's it said Schanze will forfeit an orange parasail as a substitute asset for the paraglider involved in the illegal conduct. 'Judge Benson also ordered him not to land a paraglider in a federally designated Wilderness Area or in any area closed to motorized access by a federal agency,' the statement said. On Thursday, Schanze who is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain, yet again turned a court hearing into a spectacle. It started when he arrived about five minutes late and entered court wearing dark sunglasses, a tight-fitting black turtleneck, tennis shoes and a fanny pack.

"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, I saw this strange plane. This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said.

City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end.

"Steven Davis believes the fact so many Southampton players worked under Mauricio Pochettino could give them the edge in this weekend's vital match against Tottenham. The former Argentina defender last season led Saints to their best ever Premier League points tally during a memorable campaign at St Mary's. Southampton fans' goodwill towards Pochettino was soon eroded, though, as his departure to White Hart Lane proved the catalyst to an unparalleled summer talent drain. Steven Davis (pictured against Hull earlier this month) says Southampton have an advantage over Spurs . Davis' assertions come as Mauricio Pochettino heads to Southampton for the first time since leaving . Despite that, just a point and a place separate Saints and Spurs as a remarkable season comes to a close, with a positive result for the hosts on Saturday enough to break the points record set last term. Victory would see Ronald Koeman's men usurp Spurs in the standings and bolster their European chances, with Davis, one of many to have worked under Pochettino, well aware of what a 'big game' this is for all connected to the club. 'The players never back away from (the fact this is a big game),' the Northern Ireland captain said. 'It's nice to be in a position where we're having big games at this stage of the season and there's an importance on it. 'We're looking forward to the game and hopefully we can bounce back and get the three points. 'It is great to be in a position where we're still challenging for a European spot at this stage.

Tottenham are the only current Premier League side Southampton have failed to beat since their Premier League return in 2012 - a run Davis believes the players' knowledge of Pochettino's methods can help them end.

Dr Teresa Belton insists that there are many simple things - such as inviting a lonely person out to tea - that we can do on a daily basis to increase happiness, and they are all free . Researcher and education expert at the University of East Anglia, Dr Teresa Belton, believes that people living modestly tend to find more satisfaction in their lives. Simple activities such as inviting someone out for a cup of tea, singing in a community choir and practicing good posture can all improve general wellbeing. This is because they are all activities that generate a sense of belonging, and help the person adopt confident habits.

Wellbeing means that we both feel good and function well.' Her book, Happier People Healthier Planet, supports the belief that while many strive for material things that may generate temporary happiness, it is not sustainable way to be.

"Michael Buckley, 60, from Forest Hill, south east London, died after being hit by a shopping trolley as he bought festive groceries at Marks & Spencer . A shopper caused the death of a frail widower by 'deliberately ramming' him with her trolley, a court heard yesterday. Melanie Buck is said to have become frustrated because the food aisles in Marks & Spencer were gridlocked by Christmas shoppers. When she could not get past 60-year-old Michael Buckley she exchanged heated words with him before knocking him over with her trolley, it was alleged. Mr Buckley – who suffered from diabetes and weighed only 8st – fell to the floor in the M&S aisle and broke his thighbone and wrist. When a shop assistant rushed to help him, he allegedly told her: 'She rammed me.' The following day, an operation under general anaesthetic to repair 5ft 5in Mr Buckley's injuries appeared to go well. But on Christmas Day his condition worsened after he suffered what doctors believe was a heart attack. He was taken into intensive care and put on a life- support machine. Two months later, the decision was taken to turn off the machine and he was pronounced dead. Prosecuting at Croydon Crown Court yesterday, David Howker QC said Miss Buck, 33, was out shopping with her mother on December 22, 2012. She arrived at the store in The Glades shopping centre, in Bromley, south-east London, at about 1pm. Mr Buckley, who wore a hearing aid and was described as 'frail', arrived after her and the pair bumped into each other in a food aisle. Mr Howker said: 'It appears there was something of a gridlock in the aisle and the defendant could not get past him. 'There may have been a clash between his basket and her trolley and a few words exchanged. 'But the upshot was that Miss Buck, perhaps out of a sense of frustration, deliberately rammed Mr Buckley with her trolley and the result was to knock him to the floor.' He added: 'Miss Buck assaulted Mr Buckley causing him to fall to the floor and injure himself and cause the chain of events that led to his death. She is responsible for that death.' As she made her way out of the store, the defendant was followed by a shop worker who told her she could not leave, the court heard.

"A South American president appears to have fallen for the oldest trick in the book after unwittingly posing for a photo next to a child wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt. Ecuador's leader Rafael Correa was pictured with his arm around the boy - seemingly oblivious to the message on the shirt and the large arrow that was pointing in his direction. The casually-dressed 52-year-old is said to be able to speak fluent English - but seemingly failed to pick up the meaning of the T-shirt.

It is now trending with the hashtag #IAmWithStupidMashi, referring to the official Twitter account of the president @MashiRafael. It also prompted thousands of comments including the suggestion that the child was a CIA agent brought in to damage the president's reputation. The phjoto was shared thousands of times and prompted a series of fake pictures, including the one above . However, his supporters quickly rallied behind him and used the hashtag #WeAreWithYouMashi to fight back. According to the BBC, the boy's mother said that her son had not known the meaning of the T-shirt himself and she is quoted as saying: 'We don't want to shame the president'. Correa, who was first elected in 2006, is popular among Ecuadorians for his government's social spending but has also faced criticism for intolerance of dissent.","Rafael Correa posed for a picture next to a child wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt .

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has called for realism in their survival quest and insisted that their remaining fixtures will make it extremely tough to avoid relegation. They will escape the drop zone for the first time since November if they beat Swansea at home on Saturday by three goals and Burnley fail to win at Everton.

"A suicidal Air Force veteran claims he was put on hold repeatedly by the VA helpline on Saturday night and almost ended it all as his depression nearly got the better of him. Missing his wife who had recently passed away from cancer, a desperate Ted Koran, 59, phoned the Veterans Suicide Hotline but all he got was a recorded message. Ted said he was put on hold three times for 10 minutes at a time and the only reason he decided not to kill himself on Saturday was to care for the 60 rescue animals he and his wife had looked after together. Scroll down for video . Depression: Ted Koran says that he came very close to ending his own life when he failed to get through to a counselor on the VA Suicide Hotline on Saturday . 'My wife and I saved them, and they saved me,' Ted Koran said to ABC Action News from his home in Florida. Ted Koran's experience highlights the increasing problems the VA is facing with its Veterans Crisis Hotline as it fights depression among ex-servicemen. First set up in 2007, the service had 60 calls a day on four manned phone lines. Today it has 52 operators fielding up to 1,000 phone calls a day, but the service is at breaking point. Despite statistics which say 22 veterans end their lives every day across the US, depressed former soldiers are still being put on hold by helplines.

"On Sunday night, at the Stade Velodrome, it’s the Dockers against the Dauphins. The Stevedores against the Stéphanes. Marseille vs Paris Saint-Germain — the hard-nosed, port-city, blue-collar roustabouts against the rich, privileged, capital-city-slickers. Or at least, that’s the way many want it portrayed. The way many in Marseille have always viewed it — and always will.

Even if the title were not so finely balanced, this fixture guarantees ferocity. Culturally, socially and historically, there is deep enmity. But it is also a contest which pitches Marseille’s ultra-eccentric, ‘is he a fraud/is he a genius?’ coach, Marcelo Bielsa, right where he wants to be. Bear with me, we’ll return to that thought. So obsessive has Bielsa been about football for so long that it has devoured him. The man who took 7,000 videos of matches, goals, players, free-kicks, corners and penalties with him to Japan as coach of Argentina at the 2002 World Cup (his team were knocked out in the first round) has reached a stage whereby no matter how well he instructs, no matter how much sagacity there is in that strange old head of his bursting to get out, the damage inflicted by his relentless intensity makes the experience pyrrhic. However, in fairness, pyrrhic does mean victory — just at too great a cost. Ergo, there has thus far been some success for the man who appointed him — Marseille president Vincent Labrune. Initially, he reckoned: ‘Getting Marcelo, the perfect man for our project, was a huge stroke of luck. ‘I still sometimes ask myself how on earth we managed to get a coach like Bielsa.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the predator colleges -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a debt strike, publicly declaring their refusal to","Corinthian Colleges is one of the worst of the predator colleges -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year.

"The little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of Al Qaeda, the MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend.

"(CNN)Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding: . It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow. For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color. Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the blood moon. NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a tetrad. The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28.

"Hong Kong (CNN)An impressive art collection assembled by the late actress and Hollywood icon, Lauren Bacall, has officially been offered for purchase. The collection, which includes works by some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, went under the hammer in New York on March 31, following a tour of Hong Kong, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Bacall, who died in August 2014 at the age of 89, first shot to international fame in 1944 with her first film, To Have And Have Not. That was also when the husky-voiced starlet met her future husband, Humphrey Bogart. At the recent 2015 Golden Globes, George Clooney paid tribute to the silver screen queen in his award winning speech. I don't remember what awards Lauren Bacall won, I just remember her saying: 'You know how to whistle, don't you Steve. You just put your lips together and blow.' said Clooney, referring to one of her most legendary lines from her first movie. The 750-piece collection, which fetched a total of $3.64 million, featured bronze sculptures, jewelry, and a number of decorative arts and paintings, which were sold at Bonhams auction house in New York. Her collection is truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life, said Jon King, Bonhams' vice president. Among the 50 items highlighted in the auction preview were six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain's greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall's favorite artists, whom she developed a close relationship with. One of them sold for close to $120,000. Also for sale were some of Bacall's most loved jewelry pieces, created by legendary French designer Jean Schlumberger, most known for his work at Tiffany & Co. A rose diamond camel brooch by British jeweler Elizabeth Gage fetched $23,750 and was accompanied by the original drawing and correspondence from the designer, which shows the close-knit relationship Bacall had with Gage. The wide-ranging collection was expected to appeal to a variety of collectors: fine arts and antiques dealers, fans of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, as well as memorabilia enthusiasts. Most of the items auctioned come from the apartment in New York's Dakota Building that she shared with her second husband, actor Jason Robards, until 1969. But King said fans of Humphrey Bogart would have been pleased to know some of the items were also from their shared residence in Los Angeles. King, who got to know Bacall in her late years, said the collection reflects the actress' eclectic taste","An impressive art collection assembled by the late actress and Hollywood icon, Lauren Bacall's, fetched $3.6 million at auction in New York on March 31 .

"The Eiffel Tower has been closed after workers walked out in support of the unions strike against the government's austerity measures. The nationwide strike follows action by French air traffic controllers which involved a two-day walkout starting yesterday. Now workers at the most visited paid monument in the world have joined the walkout in a solidarity with the thousands taking to the streets across the country in union-led protests against public spending cuts. Signs were placed at the foot of the Eiffel Tower warning that the landmark was closed due to strike action . There are an average 25,000 ascents at the tower every day, and at 15.50 (£11.25) a ticket, the closure will cost Paris tourism almost 387,500 (£280,000) in entry fees, excluding gifts bought and food and drink sales. Speaking to The Local, union representative Stephane Dieu said that '90 per cent' of staff had voted to strike and that signs had been placed at the foot of the tower to ensure 'tourists don't hang around for nothing.' The marches nationwide with a main rally in Paris are a test of how much support unions can muster over spending curbs which they claim undermine public service and purchasing power to the detriment of the euro zone's second-largest economy. Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs are being affected by strike action . Local media said staff who man Paris's Eiffel Tower would keep it shut it until 6pm local time as part of the strike. Representative of CGT union, one of the unions who voted to strike, Stéphane God, told AFP that the Tower is expected to be shut for 18 hours in total . Unions said they expected tens of thousands of marchers to join the main rally in Paris by the end of the day. The strike by air controllers has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. The Eiffel Tower is due to reopen to the public at around 6pm this evening .

"Decided? Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage . Ruth Bader Ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage, a report has claimed, ahead of a landmark Supreme Court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide. The famously liberal justice, who is 82, will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same-sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states. Ginsburg, who has sat on the court since 1993, has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases. cutting against a long-held tradition of not speaking out in advance. The new report, Yahoo! Politics, cited interviews in which Ginsburg has referred to the American public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same-sex ceremonies. Ahead of the first such ceremony, held in Washington, D.C., in August 2013, she told the Washington Post that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement. She said the wedding, of her friend Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, to economist John Roberts, would 'be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship.' She will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of Obergefell v. Hodges, for which arguments will be heard from Tuesday and a decision is expected this summer. The case is being brought by James Obergefell, an Ohio man who married his husband in Maryland but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband's death certificate in his home state. Currently 37 states allow gay marriage, as well as Washington, D.C. - but Ohio is one of 13 which has held out.

"Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite, according to an animal rescue expert. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from Dockweiler State Beach, just west of the city's international airport, said Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera. The initial police report said the animal was a small seal. Marine Animal Rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it . Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup (not pictured) in a blanket and left in a car around from Dockweiler State Beach . But a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion, according to Peter Wallerstein, the president of the group Marine Animal Rescue. The rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old, said Wallerstein, who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help. Sea lions of this size are 'really small, really look cute, but they're dangerous,' he said. 'These are wild animals.' They're also not fit to be kept as pets. Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous, officials warned . 'The animal needs fluids, needs special treatments,' he said. 'You can't just feed it dog food. It's not going to work.'

"(CNN)The Solar Impulse 2, the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel, has been grounded by the weather in China. What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. You can believe that your will can influence the weather, says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers. But then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature. Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. Our boss is the sun, says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear. Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii.

In an open letter to the Seattle Times, Knox said she was ‘relieved and grateful’ that the court had found her innocent. She said she felt ‘lucky’ to have had the support of those belief ‘helped me survive when I was at my most vulnerable and almost entirely lost.’ She only survived the seven year ordeal she said ‘because my dear family gave up their lives to be with me in Italy, because scores of friends donated their resources, because my lawyers worked tirelessly to bring attention to the evidence that exonerated me, because strangers — from world-renowned DNA experts to former FBI crime-scene investigators to everyday citizens — saw the injustice in my case and spoke out.' Because of this she said she felt compelled to ‘give back’. She said: ‘I am all too aware of how lucky I am to have received such strong support. I am also aware that countless other wrongfully convicted persons do not have such support. I will work to give a voice to those individuals. I will do this because I know how a wrongful conviction can destroy one’s life.’ Knox -who was reportedly paid £2.7million ($4million) for her 2013 book Waiting to Be Heard -could be in line for millions in compensation for time wrongly spent in prison.

"CPRE president Sir Andrew Motion, who is demanding a national clean-up . Council chiefs were condemned last night after claiming it was too dangerous to collect the roadside litter blighting Britain. Winchester Council in Hampshire said its annual clean-up of roads around the city had been hit by new Health and Safety Executive rules designed to protect litter-pickers from traffic. But the HSE denied tightening rules – and said councils were ‘over-interpreting’ legislation. Last night, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion, now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, accused town hall bosses and the Highways Agency of ruining the countryside by failing to remove rubbish. He said: ‘Every day, people tell us that they are disgusted, angry and ashamed of the state of England’s roads. ‘Nobody wants to drive through our beautiful countryside or approach a vibrant city, heralded only by discarded rubbish.’ Although laws to fine people who throw litter from vehicles were now in place, their implementation had been delayed by ‘shameful time-wasting’, Sir Andrew said. ‘Without funding to tackle the problem, I fear our roads will become corridors of waste,’ he added. Highways England – the Government-owned company launched last week to replace the Highways Agency – is required to keep the motorway network clean, but responsibility for clearing A-roads and trunk routes is divided between the agency and councils. Scroll down for video . Peter Silverman, of pressure group Clean Highways, said: ‘Of course safety is paramount but councils are always looking for excuses and this is just the latest.

We will continue to investigate what more can be done.’ Winchester Council insisted that the HSE had ‘clarified’ last June that litter-picking was covered by the same code of practice that governs employees","Campaigners accused councils of 'shutting their eyes' to roadside litter .

'Eden was there for my last year at Lille,' Lichtsteiner told the Independent. 'In training you could just see that he was an incredible player, he had something that nobody else had.

"(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises, in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering a psychotic episode at the time, according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012, the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men,","The trial of James Holmes, accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a Colorado movie theater in 2012, begins Monday .

"Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America options for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region. The warships are being deployed to monitor ships traveling from Iran that could be trafficking arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN, saying the move was also meant to reassure allies in the region. By having American sea power in the region, we have created options for ourselves, said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. He noted that the nine ships in the Iranian convoy were cargo ships, but he declined to specify what they were carrying beyond containers. International officials are concerned that Iran could surreptitiously attempt to transfer weaponry to the Houthis. President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. What we've said to them is if there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem, Obama said in the interview, a clip of which aired on NBC Nightly News. We're not sending them obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it, Obama said. While the Iranian ships remain in international waters, the U.S. and other partner nations can keep an eye on the Iranian ships to see if they move toward Yemeni territorial waters. But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said. I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships, State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe. Warren too added that he was unaware of any direct contact between the American and Iranian vessels at this point. The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region. There is a message for Iran as well. A U.S. military official told CNN that aircraft from aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are also conducting manned reconnaissance to monitor all maritime traffic moving through the area the Roosevelt is operating in to determine what is going on there in order to assist in making informed decisions","Nine Iranian ships transiting through the Bab al-Mandeb strait between Iran and Yemen .

"Dope smokers beware: If Marco Rubio or Chris Christie manage to elbow out the competition and win the White House in 2016, they'll crack down on pot in states that have legalized marijuana. The Republican presidential hopefuls told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in separate interviews on Tuesday that they'd enforce federal drug laws and block the sale of marijuana in Colorado and Washington.

Questioned about cannabis last year by ABC News' Jon Karl, Rubio took a hard-line stance, saying, 'I think there’s no responsible way to recreationally use marijuana.' 'I don’t want my kids to smoke marijuana, and I don’t want other people’s kids to smoke marijuana,' he said at the time. He refused to tell Karl if he'd engaged in any marijuana-related youthful indiscretions, arguing that","Marco Rubio and Chris Christie vow to crack down on pot if they win the White House in 2016 .
