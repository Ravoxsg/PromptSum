A OSCE medic provides first aid Andrei Lunev, a reporter for a Russian television channel, after he stepped on a landmine trip wire in Shirokine near Mariupol while covering the conflict in East Ukraine . Mr Lunev stepped on the landmine while inspecting the ruins of Shyrokyne, which has seen heavy shelling and changed hands repeatedly throughout the conflict, with a small group of journalists. Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier. The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine's once industrial heartland in ruins.

Recovering: Reporter Mr Lunev was taken to hospital where he later regained consciousness . Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period, while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes. The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed. Lysenko also reported civilian casualties, including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area, north of Donetsk. Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky. The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin, spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday, but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting. 'The Russian-backed separatists continue to take aggressive action in Ukraine,' she said. 'And the Russian-backed separatists continue to stall Minsk implementation.", "target": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Journalist at Russian TV channel step on landmine in east Ukraine .
