Would-be Siennas hoping to appear in an advert for bottled water should be 5ft 6in in height and have a 25\u00bdin waist, the advert states. Their \u2018low hip\u2019 measurement should be 36\u00bdin while their \u2018high hip\u2019 should come in at 35in.

The casting request even gives details of the 33-year-old\u2019s head and wrist circumferences. The hopeful extra must not have tattoos or body piercings and must be prepared to cut her hair into a messy bob, just like Miss Miller\u2019s. And, if measuring up to these remarkable standards is not enough, the successful stand-in must also be an expert in yoga. According to the casting call, the advert, for Austrian water brand V\u00f6slauer, will star Miss Miller and feature a group of girls \u2018having a laugh while they perform very hard yoga moves in a private class\u2019. The commercial \u2018uses the effortless and feminine elegance of the girls to personify the true spirit of V\u00f6slauer\u2019.

The fee for the body double is set at just \u00a3500.
