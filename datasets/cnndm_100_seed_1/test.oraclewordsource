 managed adviser | Jurgen | Vogts development players Europe => Berti Vogts has teamed up with his former player Jurgen Klinsmann after taking up a role to work behind the scenes with the United States national team. Vogts, who managed Klinsmann during his spell as Germany coach during the 1990s, was hired as technical adviser to the US on Thursday after serving as a special adviser before and during last year's World Cup. In an interview last May, Vogts said he has known Klinsmann since he was 16 or 17 and even takes credit for turning him into the striking sensation he would become. Berti Vogts has joined USA as a technical adviser teaming up again with Jurgen Kilnsmann . Vogts managed Klinsmann when he was in charge of Germany during the 1990s . 'He was a winger and then I told him, "Oh, that's not your best position, you have to play in the middle",' Vogts recalled. 'He did that and he started a big, big career. He is always enthusiastic. He's more American than a German. The Germans are thinking about things. Jurgen is always positive. That's an American way of life. That's good. That's good for the team, good for the sport, good for all of them.' Vogts will oversee the development of players in Europe, and collaborate with Herzog and Matthias Hamann on scouting, talent identification and club relationships. 'We had a fantastic experience with Berti during the 2014 FIFA World Cup,' Klinsmann said in a statement. 'His knowledge and experience is a tremendous asset for us. With Andi Herzog having a big focus on qualifying the U-23 team for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Berti will make an even more important contribution.' USA were beaten 3-2 by Denmark in a friendly on Wednesday night . Former Tottenham striker Klinsmann watches his side during the friendly defeat by Denmark . The 68-year-old Vogts was a defender on West Germany's championship team at the 1974 World Cup and made 96 international appearances in all. He coached his national team from 1990-98, winning the 1996 European Championship with Klinsmann as captain. Vogts also coached Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga and the national teams of Kuwait (2001-02), Scotland (2002-04), Nigeria (2007-08) and Azerbaijan (2008-14). 'For me he's been a big mentor throughout my life,' Klinsmann said last year, 'and he just has an outstanding soccer brain, an outstanding knowledge the way he reads the game, the way he analyzes things with his tremendous experience he has, is unquestionable, a huge benefit for us.'

'Our game plan is to be smart and take one fight at a time - like all 47 fights.' 'This is a fight the world can't miss, it is an unbelievable match-up. I'm in the gym working right now, dedicating myself to the sport because I've never wanted to win a fight so much in my life. 'One thing I do know about any sport, when you lose it is in your mind.

Stephen Espinoza says Tyson-Lewis, Mayweather-Canelo did not generate anywhere near the excitement that Mayweather-Pacquiao has done so far. He says that Pacquiao has been always been high on Mayweather's list and that the first fight didn't happen in 2009 because of the infamous drug-testing clause. Bob Arum talking about the importance of this fight - which he says the whole world will be watching. He says 'it is a credit to the sport of boxing' that this fight is happening.

Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls, let's get ready to rumble. After all the talk and hype, finally the two fighters are about to come on stage. Apparently, Mayweather made £2,500 in his first pro-fight when he beat Roberto Apodaca. On May 2 he will earn a little bit more than that. No wonder he is smiling... The reel of highlights continues, with the audience now treated to Pacquiao's dominant performance against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 - a fight that turned Pacquiao into a superstar. Ok, now we are back to Mayweather and his unanimous points win over Juan Manual Marques back in 2009. The Money man knocked down his opponent in the second round and dominated the fight from start to end. Ok, now
 University Alabama frat | Sigma Alpha Epsilon 1856 | agitation | question member later | claimed black 1966 took seven ballots brothers | incidents themed Cripmas party University suspended Washington University St. Louis 2013 | SAE => Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity at the center of the racist University of Oklahoma video, has its roots in the pre-Civil War Deep South. 'We came up from Dixie land,' says a ditty from an old songbook, boasting about SAE's success. Now, nearly 160 years after its founding at the University of Alabama, another song - this one chanted by members of the frat's University of Oklahoma chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the bad old times in the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group's activities over the years. SAE officials insist the chant is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members. This is believed to be a portrait of the original founding members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in 1856 at the University of Alabama . Chappell Cook (bottom row, second from right) objected to the fraternity expanding North because he believed 'agitation' over slavery would make it impossible for 'harmony' Though the fraternity has its own fraught racial history. Members originally planned to keep the fraternity on in the South. When the question of 'Northern Expansion' was brought up, one charter member - later a Confederate army surgeon - said he didn't think heading north was wise because 'the constant agitation of the slavery question' would make getting along impossible. It is claimed that the fraternity did not invite a black member until 1966 - and it took one activist brother seven ballots and a threat to ban every other new pledge before the other brothers assented. In more recent years, fraternity chapters across the country have gotten into trouble over racial incidents - including a hip hop-themed 'Cripmas party' at Clemson University and an entire chapter being suspended at Washington University at St. Louis in 2013 over allegations of racial insensitivity. If there are any other chapters that use the song, 'we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior,' said Sigma Alpha Epsilon spokesman Brandon Weghorst. The lyrics 'are so hateful and spiteful that it's embarrassing to think that Sigma Alpha Epsilon members would even know the chant or how it goes, if they've heard it.' The fraternity was also investigating reports of other SAE incidents that may have been tainted with racism, Weghorst said. Outed: Levi Pettit was identified by his family on Tuesday night. They apologized for his 'disgusting' behavior. Right, Pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school Highland Park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo . Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . SAE began on the Tuscaloosa campus on March 9, 1856, a few months after Noble Leslie DeVotie outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the Black Warrior River. The initial members visualized 'a bond which would hold them together for all time,' William C. Levere wrote in a 1916 history of the fraternity. 'So it came about that in the late hours of a stormy night, the friends met in the old southern mansion and by the flicker of dripping candles organized Sigma Alpha Epsilon.' More chapters were soon launched in Tennessee, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C., at what is now George Washington University. But the founders weren't interested in a national presence. According to Levere, it was their intention 'to confine the fraternity to the southern states.' When a North Carolina chapter member raised the topic of a 'Northern Extension,' charter member Thomas Chappell Cook - who later served as a surgeon in the Confederate army - responded that 'the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters, as it would preclude the possibility of harmony.' The Civil War soon put an end to the internal debate. The fraternity's charter was surrendered in 1861 because of the fighting. The Washington City Rho chapter was the only one to emerge from the war intact. SAE would not return to its birthplace until 1886, after the Reconstruction-era ban on 'secret societies' was relaxed and the school's trustees, in the words of Levere, repealed 'its obnoxious anti-fraternity laws.' In the meantime, the fraternity had granted its first Northern charter in 1883 to, of all schools, Pennsylvania College — the abolitionist institution now known as Gettysburg College. The editors of the New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture call SAE 'the first Greek-letter society founded in Dixie to take permanent root ...' Even in those early years, the fraternity sought to prove that it's more than just a provincial organization. The international headquarters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is seen in Evanston, Illinois. The organization re-located to Illinois after being founded in pre-Civil War Alabama . SAE was proud to claim President William McKinley as a member at Ohio's Mount Union College — even though it was an honorary initiation that came long after McKinley's college days. In December 1930, the fraternity dedicated its international headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Evanston. But, like other fraternities North and South, SAE had not yet embraced racial diversity. In his 2013 book, 'The People's Advocate,' attorney Daniel P. Sheehan claims credit for championing the bid of Tommy Williamson, who he wrote was 'the first black man to ever receive a nomination for membership in SAE in the entire history of that old, traditional southern fraternity.' According to Sheehan, he was social chairman of SAE's Harvard chapter in 1966. He and Williamson, a defensive lineman on the Crimson football team, both lived at Kirkland House, and Williamson's was the first name he called when it was time to vote for new members. On the first ballot, Sheehan said, Williamson received three 'blackballs,' or negative votes. Sheehan then announced he would
 Suffolk menu bid stocks | squirrel said similar taste low | conserve => A butcher whose countryside estate began running short of rabbits started selling squirrel - and the meat has proved so popular it sold out in three hours. Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk is restricted to the numbers of rabbits it can shoot every month due to plummeting numbers and added the unusual delicacy to its menu in a bid to replace stocks. The free range squirrel is white in texture and is said to have a similar taste to rabbit while being low in fat. Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk have added squirrel to their menu after their levels of rabbit starting running low. The unusual delicacy became so popular with customers it sold out in three hours . James Holliday, forestry and conservation manager at the estate, said: 'Rabbits are no longer breeding 'like rabbits'. 'Nationally, numbers have been in decline over the past few years and have now reached such low numbers we are limiting the number killed in order to maintain a sustainable population. 'The population had been decreasing since the 1950s and it has become increasingly important for us to conserve as many rabbits as possible. 'We have been catching the squirrels for a while now but obviously the reduction of rabbits made us think we could use them as a substitute and it has done very well.' The meat is being used in a variety of recipes by the estates customers, including a squirrel pasty (pictured) Richard Howard, food shop manager at the estate, said squirrel meat could be a healthy addition to diets. He said: 'Squirrel from Elveden is wild, nutritious and has virtually zero food miles, coming straight from the estate itself, making for a highly ethical mix.' The meat is being used in a variety of recipes by the estates customers, including a squirrel pasty.
 pair | dangerous times | deforestation Amazon => A Brazilian man known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ came face-to-face with a pair of snakes in his latest date with danger. Captured on camera, Arteval Duarte holds what appear to be two BCC Boa Constrictors – native to South America – in his hands as he addresses the camera. He releases the snakes – also known as Red-tailed boas – and starts to blow up a balloon, dodging one of the snakes that lunges at him. The snakes watch him intently as the balloon he is inflating gets bigger and closer to them before violently lunging at him without warning. Bursting the balloon instantly, the snake comes incredibly close to puncturing the man's face. The viper then retreats back to its original position and Duarte begins to blow up another balloon. Arteval Duarte is known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ because of his many filmed encounters with snakes . Duarte moves closer to the Boa Constrictors while blowing up a balloon, causing one of them to strike . He repeats the dangerous feat three more times – the two snakes taking it in turns to pop the balloons as he compliments their intelligence. The video concludes with the snake ninja approaching the constrictors on the table and after dodging another lunge, grabbing and holding onto them. According to Duarte, the two snakes have been trained to obey his commands and bursting balloons from his mouth like this appears to be something they are used to doing. The motive for the stunt is in apparent protest against the deforestation of the Amazon. The mouth of the snake that bursts the balloon is only inches away from puncturing Duarte's face . Duarte blows up a total of four balloons and the two snakes appear to take it in turns bursting them . Arteval has specialised in performing bizarre stunts with snakes for 15 years to protest the deforestation of the Amazon . Arteval says that he dedicates his life to protecting the habitats of animals and that his videos bring attention to the problems. Specialising in bizarre stunts for over 15 years, Arteval has also been recorded putting tarantulas and scorpions in his mouth. He has been bitten by many snakes in his time, which may give an explanation for the bandage on his arm.
 Marfa Journal naked | nun chain underwear movie | large marine crustacean | bare chest => Chloe Sevigny has posed with just a lobster covering her modesty. Save her fashion jacket and mirror sandals, the 40-year-old can be seen on the cover of the Marfa Journal stark naked and sprawling out over a retro kitchen work top. The actress, who is considered an influencer within many fashion circles, makes a series of bizarre statements from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood as she creates four fake movie posters for the magazine. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT . Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch . The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre. In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean. Stark naked: Besides a long fashion coat and a belt, Chloe was stark naked in the snaps . Provocative: Chloe posed on her knees wearing knickers and a chain between her legs . The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt. She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting. While it is not believed that the lobster is real, PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters. 'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise . Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters . Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf. The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette. Youthful: The star looked sensational with her trim shape on show in a vintage costume . Fashion fan: Stylist Haley Wollens used Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Hot: The star summed it up perfectly with Hot In Psychotic written on her bare chest . Retro: The stylish star enjoyed a throwback moment in a velvet bra and trousers . Third issue: The Marfa Journal is a bi-annual European publication that combines of art and fashion . And the cheeky starlet certainly does look hot. Youthful beyond her 40 years, the fashion darling shoots a full view of her bare behind, on which a temporary cherry tattoo can be seen in another daring image. Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike. Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week. The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. ‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.’ Cheeky: The model and actress bent over a dirt bike in her crystal whites, including a bonnet . Wild one: She didn't managed a smile but instead a moody stare while showing off her bare bottom . 'So much is about marketing and selling the product,' the star continued. And her latest photo shoot appears to be yet further poking fun at the movie industry. Moving away from Hollywood, Chloe's latest career move is her sixth collection in collaboration with Opening Ceremony. The Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear line is themed around preppy chic, inspired by the satirical ’80s cult film Heathers. Sassy: Chloe was modelling in a leotard and pointed boots with Hello Kitty designs . Retro: She enjoyed seventies styling in a patterned jumpsuit and long mermaidian locks . Magazine star: Four fake movie posters divide the whole magazine into four sections: Raw, Decadent, Romantic and Progressive .
 Rand presidency brand | Kentucky senator appeal | younger => (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul, who is expected to announce on April 7 that he will be running for the presidency, is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism. The Kentucky senator's widely publicized appearance this month at the South by Southwest festival at Austin, Texas, was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech-savvy audience. His particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and Republican conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack. Younger Republicans, the much-desired millennial vote, seem attracted by what they are hearing. What accounts for his appeal? In an era when so many Americans seem frustrated with shallow, personality-based politics, there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas. For many disaffected younger Republicans, Paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern GOP. For almost half a century, "big government conservatism" has ruled the party. Although conservatism is theoretically about limited government, the historical reality has been much different. On national defense, the hawks of the GOP have been victorious. Even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government, Republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military-industrial complex. Though the GOP has little tolerance for many social safety net programs, the party has accepted sizable government support to industry, such as the financial bailout known as TARP in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests. Paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the GOP has embraced in recent decades, during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation-building and regime change. For some Republicans, including Paul, these policies were at the heart of the failures of George W. Bush's presidency and a sharp departure from the party's principles. Similarly, Paul has been one of the few Republican voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties. At the local level, he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement officers. Paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that don't sit well with a growing number of Republican voters. He has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana. He has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of Republicans are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction. While many Republicans have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from Democrats, most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas. Indeed, the recent budget blueprint from congressional Republicans exposed how thin discussions of a Republican anti-poverty program are. Their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare and regressive supply side tax cuts. But Paul, who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget, has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas, including criminal justice reform, that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated African American communities. Can Paul really win? That is unclear. Republican strategist Matthew Dowd told The New York Times: "It's one thing to be interesting; it's another thing to be compelling. They've got to see him sitting in the Oval Office. And I do not think Rand has crossed that threshold yet." There are many skeptics who don't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record. Paul's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him, as will some of his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure. Paul is still a Republican, so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the GOP. He is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive. While Paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable, some of his supporters smell a sellout. Arguably, we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to Iran led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas (a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish Bill Kristol), switched his approach to the issue of same-sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against ISIS. "This is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip," the editor of an anti-war website told the Daily Beast. "This was the last straw. I've put up with a lot from that guy! I've had to defend him like a Jesuit. I'm done. Let somebody else do it." But if Rand Paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the Republican candidates, at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the GOP by raising questions about some of the party's core positions.
 X Factor mane | Girl hairstyle Aloud | following marriage year => Unveiled with great and solemn self-importance, after a teaser shot of a pair of scissors and a comb on Instagram, here is the essential haircut for 2015. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini — pop starlet turned X Factor Judge — yesterday revealed she has had her image-defining mane of long extensions snipped off. ‘Long overdue!’ she sighed on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Snap! Cheryl may have tucked her hair behind her ear, but doesn't her new bob look very familiar? Victoria Beckham wore it first, back in 2007 . Proenza Schouler woven mini dress . Now reduced to $747 at The Outnet! Visit site . So Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has chopped off her long locks. We imagine people will be frantically calling up salons and asking for a new hairdo on a scale not seen since the Nineties phenomenon that was 'The Rachel'... But we wouldn't be surprised if the singer and X Factor judge took such drastic action just so she could show off the back of this dress in all its glory! She was filming for the Graham Norton show and even though her stylist Anna Hughes-Chamberlain only gave us a sneak peak of the back of the dress, they don't call us Fashion Finder for nothing you know! A bit of investigative work revealed that this dress is by Proenza Schouler and we love the woven texture, high neck and button detailing. The front is super chic, but of course thanks to that cut out it's even better from the back! And the best news is that this dress is now hugely reduced at The Outnet, so click (right) to get your hands on it. Or if you want to bring sophisticated back a la Cheryl, check out our edit below for some white hot high street styles.

BCBGeneration cut out back dress at Asos . Visit site . Boohoo Petite cross back skater dress . Visit site . Alexander Wang pleated cotton-piqué mini dress at The Outnet . Visit site . What remains, after the attentions of her regular hair stylist Paul Percival, is a neat, layered bob, with some backcombing around the crown and shorter layers cut into the nape of the neck. Considering that she is the face of beauty giant L’Oreal, who pay her around £250,000 a year to promote their hair products, the restyle is a bold move. And you can bet that the new look will have an influence on the High Street, as Cheryl, now 31, is idolised by thousands. They may not buy her albums (her last release only managed to reach No. 7 in the charts before dropping back down), but they do buy her image. However, if imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery, then Cheryl must have a serious crush herself — on one Victoria Beckham. My fair ladies: Cheryl (left) and her lighter locks, in July 2011, mirror a golden Victoria in her Spice Girl reunion days in December 2007 . Side issue: A slick parting heralds a serious look for Cheryl in May 2011 (left), but a pouting Victoria had already got there in February 2009 . Centre stage: Both girls went for the centre parting, dark bob early in their careers - Cheryl (left) in 2002, following Posh in 1997 . Pin-ups: Cheryl (left) unveils her messy up-do at a film premiere last year, while Victoria tried her version in September 2013 . Wag alert: With extensions and a big blow-dry, it's Cheryl (left) in 2006, taking her lead from Victoria Beckham two years earlier . For, it turns out, that where the former Spice Girl leads in the hairstyle stakes, so former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl follows. Whether it is a bob, a side-plait or a bun, it seems that Cheryl likes to borrow, or revisit, looks from her style mentor. Of course Victoria, now 40, did it all first — from a career in a world-beating all-girl band to marriage to an England footballer. The two women were even friends once, particularly during the 2006 World Cup football finals in Germany, when Cheryl travelled to watch her then fiance Ashley Cole and Posh was there, too, with Becks. However, relations between the two women became frosty after Ashley was accused of cheating in 2008, just two years after their wedding, and Victoria didn’t even call. Cheryl said she’d expected rather more from her fellow WAG. In an interview in 2009, Cheryl said that Victoria’s clothes were for ‘older women’, and Victoria retaliated by saying that Cheryl’s range of shoes for fashion website Stylist Pick were ‘just a PR stunt’. Twisted sisters: Cheryl steps out with a loose side-plait last summer - a style tried successfully by Victoria (right) in April 2012 . Who's that curl? A cascading mane for both ladies - Cheryl (left) in 2012 and Victoria sporting the look a full decade earlier .

My little pony: Cheryl (left) pictured in July 2006, has a blonde ponytail - just like Victoria in 2004 . Cap that! Cheryl dons a leather cap in 2002 (left) - a year after Victoria launched her solo career with the same look . Sources in both camps indicate that they have long since made up — certainly Cheryl wore a Victoria Beckham dress in May 2012 to the premiere of the film What To Expect When You’re Expecting, and it was reported that the former Spice Girl had invited Cheryl over for dinner later that year so they could properly let bygones be bygones. So what does Cheryl’s new hair mean? It seems to be a part of a complete make-under, embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July last year, which has taken her from
 crimes punished caution | 000 offences Crown Court dealt court year | Home Affairs Select Committee points alarming rise culture => Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. Almost one in three crimes is ‘inappropriately’ punished with a police caution or penalty notice, including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, such as rape, MPs say. Some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a Crown Court were dealt with out of court in the year to June 2014, they add. Revelation: Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today . The Home Affairs Select Committee points to an ‘alarming’ rise of the caution culture – which grew and peaked under the Labour government – and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system. The committee’s report concludes that too often, police used cautions as a ‘time-saving tool’ rather than the correct way of tackling an offence. In total, police issued 318,500 of the so-called out-of-court disposals, mostly for minor offences, in 2013-14, down from 660,965 in 2008. Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘The inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable. ‘It is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases. ‘We cannot allow the misuse of out-of-court disposals in serious cases to continue. The public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said the 'inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable. The committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a ‘postcode lottery’. In Gwent, 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice, compared with 26 per cent in West Yorkshire. At the peak, one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out-of-court disposals. By last year, it had fallen to fewer than one in 20. The report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy, allowing front-line officers to spend more time pounding the beat. Arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time, and charging someone takes five hours. But too many cautions were being handed out ‘inappropriately’, says the committee. The report welcomes reforms being introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning. Six types of out-of-court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation. Minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance. More serious offenders will be give a ‘suspended prosecution’, which means they must meet a set of conditions such as paying a fine and going on a rehabilitation course to avoid further punishment. Last year the Mail revealed that 90 rapists have received only a caution since the Coalition came to power. In total, police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail, including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary.
 pupils given solar eclipse school phenomenon | watch ordered remain indoors | Hilbre High School eclipse based | class skipped lessons => Dozens of pupils were given detentions for watching the solar eclipse – at a school that had boasted it would be celebrating the ‘rare and spectacular’ phenomenon. But only younger children at the Merseyside secondary were allowed to watch the once-in-a-generation event, with the rest of the school ordered to remain indoors. Hilbre High School, Wirral, had announced an eclipse-based science project with its younger pupils, who had spent the previous week making safety goggles so they could watch it, saying: ‘Key Stage 3 will be focused on the rare and spectacular event. Hilbre High School (pictured) in Wirral, Merseyside, organised an eclipse-based project with its younger pupils but told the rest of the school to stay indoors . 'It is great to see students engaging in real-life events.’ But the ban on older children watching the eclipse sparked a revolt, with an entire class skipping lessons so they would not miss out. Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’. The solar eclipse on Friday morning was the first this century and there won't be another one for 19 years .
 Harry Kane England Alan | scored goals competitions season hat Leicester City Saturday | year old => Roy Hodgson should place his trust in Harry Kane and start the in-form Tottenham striker in England's upcoming fixtures, according to Alan Shearer. Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season, including a hat-trick against Leicester City on Saturday, and was handed his first call-up to the senior squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy. And Shearer believes the 21-year-old has done enough to merit a start for the Three Lions, despite competing up front with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge. Harry Kane took home the match ball after scoring three goals against Leicester City on Saturday . Alan Shearer says the uncapped striker should start for England in their upcoming games . Kane strokes home a penalty as Tottenham Hotspur won 3-0 at White Hart Lane in the Premier League . The former England striker said on Match of the Day: 'Well considering he didn't start playing regular Premier league football until November he is now top scorer in the league with 19 goals. I think Roy Hodgson should start him. Yes, he's in the squad but start him in the team. 'He's (Hodgson's) watched him enough times this season, he knows what he is all about an he is on fire. 'The form he is in, I think get him in there and he will score goals. He will be a great foil for Rooney and I am a big fan of his. 'I like his attitude and the way he scores all sorts of goals. I couldn't believe we aren't going to show his goals (during the analysis) but the editor said "he only scored a tap-in, a deflection and a penalty". I said "is that all?". If it was that easy Soldado would have been doing it. 'I am a huge fan of his and would without doubt get him in the England team.' The 21-year-old striker now has 29 goals in all competitions this season for Spurs . Kane sat down with Sportsmail's Martin Samuel recently to speak about his England call-up .
 remains Christian Timberlake | Pitino | team says => (CNN)"The Stomp" remains one of the most controversial plays in NCAA history -- when Duke's Christian Laettner lifted his foot and stepped on Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, the 1992 NCAA East Regional Final. Mention The Stomp in a diner or bar in Kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue-haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how Laettner is the vilest human on Earth. Then, the woulda, coulda, shouldas begin: Laettner should've been kicked out; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot; Kentucky should've advanced to the Final Four. The Stomp returned to headlines this week after ESPN aired a "30 for 30" documentary called "I Hate Christian Laettner," detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day. When it comes to The Stomp, Laettner says he decided to give a "little payback" while Timberlake lay helpless on the ground. If Kentucky fans needed more reason to hate Laettner, those words might've been it. But on Twitter, Laettner issued a video apology to Timberlake, the first time he'd ever done so: . Timberlake could've lashed back, but he's too classy for that. He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He remains active in basketball, coaching an eighth-grade girls travel-team in Atlanta. (In full transparency, I coached with him last year.) He responded to Laettner, saying he appreciates and accepts the apology. But he makes it clear where his loyalty lies. At the end of his 23-second message, Timberlake's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with: "Go Big Blue." Timberlake doesn't dwell on The Stomp. The thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by Coach Rick Pitino after the game. Pitino held up an old Sports Illustrated cover that said the Kentucky program was in shambles. Pitino told his players that although they lost on the court, his players had done something much bigger: They'd put Kentucky basketball back on the map. "It put a lot of things in perspective, especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy NCAA sanctions," Timberlake says. "All I remember is working with our heads down, attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability. And that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work, even in a loss." That is a message, he says, that still resonates in his life: "Sometimes you don't see the full picture and don't reap the immediate rewards of your work, but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen." Timberlake has had fun with The Stomp over the years, even donning a "I Still Hate Laettner" T-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when Kentucky and Duke played a couple years ago. He jokes that he's not sure if he was "a true hater" of Laettner like so many others. But that game will never quite sit well with Kentucky players and fans. However, Timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on Laettner that he thought he'd never have. "I can really respect his accomplishments, his basketball career and his passion for the game," Timberlake says. Don't get him wrong. Timberlake still bleeds Kentucky blue. He'd love to see Kentucky play Duke for the title this year, this time with the Wildcats walking away as the winners.

 identified 25 kits forgotten | 000 kits dating 1970s | backlog | Charles allegedly gunpoint backlogged | victim raped => Charles Baker, who has been arrested for a raping a woman at gunpoint after a rape kit from 2000 was finally tested . Police in Memphis have identified 25 rape suspects after finally testing evidence kits that had been forgotten about for 40 years. Some rape victims have sued the city, alleging that the failure to test around 12,000 kits, some dating back to the 1970s, has allowed too many rapists to escape prosecution. The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match. Now it has been revealed that the backlog, which is now being cleared, has identified 25 suspected rapists with 16 of them believed to have assaulted multiple victims. Memphis Police Lieutenant Cody Wilkerson also confirmed that 5,386 kits had now been sent for testing and that 58 cases have been sent to prosecutors for indictment. However, he added dozens of investigations have been cut short because of statutes of limitations on rape charges, or the deaths of victims or suspects. It comes after it emerged last month that accused rapist Charles Baker, who allegedly assaulted a woman at gunpoint, had finally been arrested after a backlogged rape kit was tested. Baker, 44, was charged with aggravated rape after the attack in Memphis 15 years ago. He is accused to have abducted the victim at gunpoint in 2000 in downtown Memphis and raped her. The woman then consented to a rape kit test but the evidence wasn't tested by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation until July 2012. It was then revealed that the DNA then matched that of Baker earlier this year. In a report about the kit testing backlog last year, former U.S. Attorney Veronica Coleman-Davis said nobody maliciously or wantonly allowed the kits to remain untested. Instead she attributed the problem to 'a general and collective failure to understand the importance of DNA testing as was reflected in common practices in place locally and nationwide.' The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match . Meanwhile in February, officials in Houston said evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested there for years has turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles. And in Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009. In Cleveland, prosecutors have also sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.
 English describe | Jahai specific words smells | Radboud | speakers rely smell words like fruity lemon => Inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling. But it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell. Scientists have found that English speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages. I'm getting blackberries and thistles: The English language is not the best for describing odours say scientists . Researchers found those who use English as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour. However, native speakers from the Jahai tribe in Perak, Malaysia, described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour. Looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant, scientists have found. Researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free. The scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher BMI themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating. This suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat. The Jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the Maniq, a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern Thailand, have 15 words. These abstract words describe smells in the same way as we use blue, red and yellow to describe colours. The findings suggest English speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells. Professor Asifa Majid, who led the work at the centre for language studies at Radboud University in Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, said: 'Our findings show that the long-held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true. 'Odours are expressible in language, as long as you speak the right language.' Professor Majid has found that the English language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells. One of the few that is used is the term 'musty', which describes a stuffy and dusty odour of an old book or room that has been unused for a long time. Most of the time English speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon. In a study published in the journal Cognition, Professor Majid asked 10 American English speakers and 10 native speakers of the Jahai to describe colours and odours. They were presented with 12 odours, including cinnamon, turpentine, lemon, smoke, chocolate, rose, onion and gasoline, and 80 different colours. They found that when describing the odours, there was little agreement among English speakers when describing the odours. The Jahai use 12 abstract words to describe odours (shown, left) in the same way they do colours (right) In many western societies, smell has become a largely under-used sense. In many cases odours have become something undesirable and to be avoided, according to Professor Majid (picture posed by a model) They also used far longer descriptions when identifying the smells. For example when presented with a cinnamon odour, English speakers described it as spicy, sweet, candy, smoky, wine and pot pourri. However, the Jahai were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells, such words that mean to 'smell edible' and 'to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers'. These works were predominantly abstract words, much like those they used for colour. However, while abstract words were dominant among the English speakers when describing colour, they used source based descriptions. In a later study in the journal of Cognition, Professor Majid and her colleagues looked at the language of the Maniq, a 300 strong nomadic tribe in southern Thailand, and found they use words for smell that have complex meanings. They wrote: 'Smell is particularly important in the lives of the Maniq, and lies at the core of the indigenous ideology. The table above shows the specific abstract words used by the Maniq tribes to describe different odours . 'The Maniq surround themselves with odors believed to be beneficial for health and that repel danger. They stay constantly alert for potentially harmful odors. 'The Maniq system is remarkable because there are dedicated terms for olfaction and these are part of everyday talk. Western languages simply lack this. When describing smells, English speakers, for example, most often resort to source-descriptors, such as like a banana or fruity, but even these descriptors are not applied accurately.' It is unclear exactly why English speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately, but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures. In a recent study published in the journal of Cognitive Linguistics, Professor Majid and her colleagues found that English speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch, smell and taste. There is a similar pattern in other western languages. However, smell plays a far greater role in the language of the Semai of Malaysia, for example. Speaking to New Scientist, Professor Majid said: 'There seems to be something culturally different too. 'People in the West seem to do everything they can to get rid of smells, and in many contexts odour is a taboo topic. 'This might be linked to changes in our smell environment since the industrial revolution. 'If you read stories from the UK or France from before the revolution, there's sewage in the streets and people are using perfume to cover up body odour. 'These days, we do everything we can to sanitise our environment.'
 blipp access information apples smartphone term | app CDs film posters | service => It didn’t take long for us to get used to Googling things, instead of looking them up in books. But the process of typing words into a search box could be replaced by using the cameras on our smartphones to find the information we’re looking for. Blippar, the world’s largest image recognition and augmented reality platform, has re-launched its app to change the way we search for things and interact with the world around us. Scroll down for video . Blippar, the world’s largest image recognition and augmented reality platform has re-launched its app, which aims to change the way we search and interact with the physical world. Users can 'blipp objects, such as CDS and adverts to access information about them online and could soon blipp any object, such as apples (shown) Users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘look’ at any object and use the image to search for it online in the long-term. But to begin with, they will be able to use it on English-language album covers, fiction books, DVD covers and movie posters. When a user ‘blipps’ one of these items or images, they will be presented with a range of information about it. For example, if they blipp an album cover, they may be presented with access to videos of the band, a source to buy tickets to an upcoming concert, details on what people are saying about them on Twitter or photos of the band itself. Users have to launch the app on their phone. The new version will be out in April. They will see a view using the phone's camera, which will show any products that are 'blippable'. When an object is detected, users will see augmented reality content, which could take the form of a video, reviews or related information. The first blippable objects on the new app will be CDs, DVDs and film posters, but more will be added. However, the app’s plans are more ambitious. Blippar aims to make the entire physical world visually searchable via mobile devices and wearables. In the future, it aims to make everything blippable, from an apple or chocolate bar, to a dog on the street or even the Eiffel Tower. Web-based search as it exists today has dominated the digital experience, both online and mobile. From inputting keywords to digging through pages of links to access information, this search behaviour is limited by vocabulary and literacy. Blippar’s image recognition service aims to go beyond language to allow consumers to pull timely, relevant information directly from the environment around them. ‘The human imagination, curiosity and the quest for knowledge are all often limited by our capacity to define and assign language to describe and seek answers from the world around us’ said Blippar Founder and CEO Ambarish Mitra. Users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘look’ at any object and use the image to search for it, and related information online. The New York and London-based company has already rolled out inority report-style advertising. A still from the film is shown . ‘Today marks the beginning of a new era of search, where curious users will be able to visually search the world through the lens of the Blippar app. ‘The technology holds massive potential for enriching real world experiences and delivering genuine value to our users. ‘The visual search is not replacing text-based search, it’s an alternate behaviour which satisfies people’s spontaneous needs of instant object focused curiosity, therefore introducing the light web.’ The company claims that Blippar’s platform allows users to access information faster than using traditional online search methods. It will also use artificial intelligence to refine and personalise the visual search results for each user. The updated app will be available to download for iOS and Android in April 2015. Last year, Blippar unveiled the first image recognition and tracking app for Google Glass wearers that shows videos, webpages, and more, simply by looking at a picture. It was the first time the technology could be used automatically, and seamlessly, just by looking at an advert. 'Blippar has already worked with thousands of the world’s largest brands and publishers to create engaging branded experiences that are triggered by objects, magazine pages, advertisements and more, “blipped” by millions of users around the world,' Mr Mitra said. There are many visual search apps competing to win users from Google. Snap Fashion, for example, lets users take a photo of an item of clothing and finds others in exactly the same colour, which they can then buy at the click of a button.
 Fernando Alonso McLaren Woking Malaysian | world | crash | year | Spaniard race => Fernando Alonso paid an unexpected visit to McLaren’s factory in Woking on Monday as he prepares for his potential return in the Malaysian Grand Prix a week on Sunday. The double world champion, who was concussed in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona last month, spoke to senior engineers during his trip. ‘He seemed in good spirits and is confident he can race in Kuala Lumpur,’ said a source within the factory. Alonso also talked through the data from the accident. Fernando Alonso was pictured with Eric Boullier at McLaren's headquarters in Woking on Tuesday . Fernando Alonso waves as he leaves hospital in Barcelona at the end of last month . Alonso and girlfriend Lara Alvarez are seen arriving in Oviedo from Barcelona hospital in February . Alonso, seen on a stretcher in a helicopter, suffered concussion from a pre-season crash in February . The 33-year-old will return to the factory – officially called the McLaren Technology Centre – this week to drive the simulator, probably on Thursday. A spokesman for the team confirmed to Sportsmail that he would spend a day on the high-tech machine, which would be set to replicate the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. It is the usual procedure for their drivers to go in the simulator before any race. However, Alonso must be cleared by the FIA’s doctors before he can get in the car again. A date for those tests has yet to be set, though they could take place in the paddock a week on Thursday. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso posted this picture showing the results of his gym work out regime . The 2005 and 2006 World Champion is all smiles with McLaren chairman Ron Dennis last December . The Spaniard spent three days in hospital after the accident and returned for further scans, but was not allowed to take part in the opening race of the season in Australia last Sunday. His place was taken by Kevin Magnussen, whose car gave up on him before the lights went out. Alonso, who is paid £27million a year, has returned to the gym to get ready for his return. Driving the simulator will allow him to restore his confidence after the discombobulating crash. His return would boost McLaren, who were last of the finishers at the weekend through Jenson Button – an even worse team display than they were expecting.
 Nicolas Sarkozy dwarfish | Buisson 65 steering | claims 5 ft heels especially => Nicolas Sarkozy’s most senior aide regularly mocked him as a ‘dwarfish Napoleon’, an ‘airhead’ and a ‘nutter’, it was claimed last night. The revelations will come as a huge blow to the former French president, 60, who is aiming for re-election in two years. Adviser Patrick Buisson, 65, was credited with steering Mr Sarkozy into the Elysee Palace, where he served between 2007 and 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy's (left) most senior aide Patrick Buisson (right) regularly mocked him, it has been claimed . But a book called The Bad Genie claims Mr Buisson frequently mocked the 5ft 5in politician, who wore stacked heels, especially when with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Mr Buisson, who is an expert on opinion polls, said Mr Sarkozy could 'do nothing without me' and would call him all the time. 'It was the Dwarf' or 'the Little One', Mr Buisson would tell colleagues after receiving a call from Mr Sarkozy. Mr Buisson was viewed as a 'compass' and 'genius' by Mr Sarkozy, despite also being referred to as a 'nutter' or 'airhead'. Sarkozy wore stacked heels, especially in the presence of his third wife, supermodel Carla Bruni . Mr Buisson would not think twice about slamming the phone down on Mr Sarkozy, saying: 'I'm having lunch, you're bothering me'. He would also put Mr Sarkozy's voice on speaker, and laugh about him with friends, saying: 'He can do nothing without me, Naboleon'. The nickname was a cross between 'Napoleon' - the legendary French leader - and the term 'nabot', which means dwarfish. Authors Ariane Chemin and Vanessa Schneider, who both write for Le Monde, said Sarkozy would phone Mr Buisson for 'reassurance' more than his wives. Mr Buisson fell out with Mr Sarkozy last year, after it emerged that he had recorded many of their conversations without the politician's consent. In one, Carla Bruni dubs her husband a 'kept man', thanks to her fortune amassed during her time as a model in the 1990s. Mr Sarkozy went on to sue his former mentor for around 70,000 pounds, saying: 'In my life I've known betrayal, but rarely one like this.' Mr Sarkozy was defeated by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, in 2012 after just one term in office. The conservative leader of the UMP Party is determined to get back into power, but is facing a range of corruption enquiries. They include claims that he received millions in back handers from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing.

 affidavit | new polio cases years | administering workers => Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine, an official said Tuesday. Peshawar Deputy Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud told CNN that the 513 arrests took place Monday and Tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated, according to the deputy commissioner. Pakistan's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons, including attacks on medical workers, the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families. Whatever the reason, the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact. Such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world. But Pakistan is an exception, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership that includes the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The South Asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years, and has nine of this year's 10 reported cases. In 2014, Pakistan had 327 cases. The next closest country was Nigeria, with 36 cases. Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops. They've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago, Mehsud said. Dr. Bilal Ahmad, a UNICEF team leader based in Pakistan, called authorities' unprecedented move a last-ditch effort to clear polio from "cluster" zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated. "First the workers (try to) convince them, then their supervisors, then senior members of the community," Ahmad said. "(This government action) is the final step in eradicating this issue." Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children, sometimes leading to paralysis and death. The virus is easily preventable through immunization, but there's no cure once it is contracted. It went from being a health issue to a security issue after U.S. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. CIA policy: Won't use vaccination programs as part of operations . Those administering the vaccines have become targets, with the National Emergency Operations Center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since December 2012. And in June 2012, Pakistani Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another Pakistani province -- North Waziristan -- because of drone strikes there. Bahadur called the strikes "worse than polio." CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta.
 girl Boulder Colorado blended mother | bleach mother carafe | attempted degree | thought => A 12-year-old girl allegedly tried to kill her own mother by poisoning a smoothie with bleach after she had her iPhone taken away. The girl, who has not been named but lives in Boulder, Colorado, allegedly blended the smoothie earlier this month, spiked it with the caustic liquid, then fed it to her unwitting mother, who drank it. Her throat was burned by the bleach, and she had to be treated in hospital - but wrote the incident off as a mistake until her daughter tried again, according to police. Plot: The pre-teen allegedly blended up a smoothie (file photo right) spiked with bleach in the hope of killing her mother after she took away her iPhone (file photo left) The Boulder County sheriff's department said that on her second attempt the woman poured bleach into a water carafe by her mother's bed. When she smelled bleach again she reportedly confronted the girl - who admitted the attempts on her life were vengeance for having her smartphone taken away. She was later arrested. According to ABC News, she was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder on Friday. A police spokesman said: 'On March 6, 2015, deputies of the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to Boulder Community Hospital to investigate an assault. 'Subsequent investigation has developed evidence that a 12-year-old Boulder County girl attempted to kill her mother on two separate occasions. 'On both attempts the girl used bleach. The first attempt on March 2, 2015 left her mother feeling ill after her daughter placed bleach into a breakfast smoothie she made. 'Mom noticed an odor of bleach in the drink and thought her daughter had cleaned the glass prior to making the beverage and did not rinse all the bleach out. 'Later in the week the girl poured bleach into a water carafe her mother kept in the bedroom. On the second occasion Mom noticed the odor of bleach in her water and confronted her daughter. 'This is when she learned her daughter had developed the plan to kill her for taking away her iPhone. 'The juvenile was detained at the Boulder County Juvenile Center.'
 found car party March 14 | 28 died | hospital | unconscious | lived => Sporty Jemma Rozier (pictured) was found slumped in the driver's seat of her car after suffering a heart attack while driving to a party on March 14 . A sporty 28-year-old woman with an existing heart condition died after suffering a fatal heart attack at the wheel of her car while driving to a party. Jemma Rozier, 28, from Swindon Village in Gloucestershire, was found slumped in the driver's seat of her car at a junction. Paramedics were called and she was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save her. Her heartbroken mother Clare, 49, said: 'It shouldn't be this way round. Devastation is the first thing that hits you. 'We were talking about her finding a husband and having children. 'She was just a normal 28-year-old living her life.' Tragedy struck after Ms Rozier left her family home and headed to a party at around 8.45pm on March 14. She was found unconscious in her car just a few miles away by a passer-by who dialled 999. Ms Rozier, who worked at Capita Insurance in Bishop's Cleeve, was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors could not save her. The keen sportswoman had a 'floppy valve' due to a heart condition but lived an active life and had shown no signs of ill health before the incident. She was a Brownie leader in Guiting Power, a keen cyclist and had recently taken up salsa dancing. Her mother added: 'She'd had regular check-ups and everything was fine. 'She was fun-loving. She was very keen on fitness. She cycled everywhere and went running with me. We're all runners in the family. 'I don't think many people probably knew about her heart condition, because it didn't restrict her. 'Never once was it a problem for her. It was a complete shock.' Ms Rozier was a Brownie leader in Guiting Power, a keen cyclist and had recently taken up salsa dancing . Her father Edward, 54, said: 'It was all so surreal until we went through and saw Jemma. We went through the motions but it just didn't seem real.' Jemma leaves behind her younger sister, Natalie, 25, who recently returned from a 13-month trip around Australia, New Zealand and America. Natalie, a fitness instructor, said: 'She meant the world to me. We were best friends as well as sisters.' Jemma's funeral takes place 2.30pm Friday March 27 at St Michael's Church in Guiting Power. Ms Rozier was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors battled in vain to save her . The mitral valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber, and helps control blood flow through the heart. During each heartbeat the smaller upper chambers of the heart contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers. The mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium, and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood, to prevent backflow. When the valve closes, its two leaflets (flaps) normally seal the valve shut. Tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side. Problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Severe problems can lead to heart failure - which is where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced. There are three main types of problem: . - Mitral regurgitation (also called 'mitral incompetence') – where there is a backflow of blood through the valve, often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse . - Mitral stenosis – where the valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting blood flow . - Mitral valve prolapse - where one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and don't close tightly, often leading to backflow of blood . These conditions can each occur alone or in combination. Source: NHS conditions .
 David little | Liverpool fans | semi Hillsborough ground April 1989 | promoted weeks => Evidence: Police officer David Duckenfield today admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 which ended in tragedy . The most senior police officer on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today apologised and admitted he was 'not the best man' for the task, adding that he was 'learning on the job'. Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, had little experience of policing football matches and had never been in charge during a game before. Giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans today, he said it was a 'serious mistake' not to consult with his predecessor about the challenges the match would pose, and apologised for 'failings' in the policing of the game. The supporters were crushed to death shortly after the start of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground on April 15, 1989. Mr Duckenfield, now 70, was a chief superintendent who was promoted to be head of the local police division two weeks before the game. He gave the order to open the gates to the ground in the minutes before the crush, allowing 2,000 fans to flood into the ground, and later wrongly claimed that a gate had been forced open. Speaking at the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire today, Mr Duckenfield was asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to do the job properly given his lack of experience. The former officer replied: 'All I would say is this, that after a period, I would say, I'm older, hopefully wiser - probably I was not the best man for the job on the day.' Mr Duckenfield said he had no recent previous experience of policing at Hillsborough before the match and his knowledge of the stadium was 'very general.' Asked later how familiar he was with the ground, Mr Duckenfield said: 'With hindsight I can almost say, knowing the events of the day, I should've spent the majority of my time as the new commander down there. 'I did in the light of the information available what I considered necessary, and, if there was a failing, well, I apologise.' The officer agreed that while he had experience of public order policing, that was 'totally different' to policing football matches. He added: 'At the time I should have thought about my limited knowledge of the role of a commander at a major event that was a sell-out when I had not been in that responsible position previously.' Mr Duckenfield said that after first joining South Yorkshire Police as a cadet in 1960, he had been 'delighted' to be promoted to the post of chief superintendent of F Division of South Yorkshire Police - including Hillsborough - around March 1989. Inexperienced: Mr Duckenfield had only recently been promoted at the time of the match . Relatives: Campaigners Margaret Aspinall, left, and Jenni Hicks, right, pictured outside the inquest today . The witness told the jury the job came with other major responsibilities, as the area was also home to a major hospital, the local university and areas of affluence and deprivation. He said, while the semi-final game was 'obviously a major priority', it was only one of the priorities he had to deal with, adding: 'I only had 15 days, and that was not 15 working days.' Mr Duckenfield said his understanding of the job of the match commander was that he would not be involved in the day-to-day or minute-by-minute duties and would only become on the day if something went wrong. Christina Lambert QC asked him: 'Did it not occur to you before the match that it was a job that called for deep experience?' Mr Duckenfield said he had been 'assured' by his boss the chief constable he could rely on the other experienced officers in his team, though he had only had a single brief conversation with his predecessor, Brian Mole. Miss Lambert asked if he thought it was a mistake to accept the role and 'not seek the assistance from others such as Mr Mole?' He replied: 'There was a culture in the police service at that time and the culture was you would be moved without any overlap and you would learn, dare I say it, on the job. So it did not cross my mind to say, 'I'm not up to the job.' I just got on with it.' Miss Lambert continued: 'My question is, in hindsight, was it a mistake?' The witness replied: 'In hindsight, it was a serious mistake. I did know what the job involved, but no one, including me, knew what might evolve on the day.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence . Mr Duckenfield said that it was necessary to keep rival fans apart from each other in order to ensure their safety, pointing to the culture of football hooliganism at the time. He said: 'The main objectives were safety and I align that with segregation, because if segregation was ensured, then safety usually followed, because of your planning. You can't separate the two.' Mr Duckenfield said he had experienced hooliganism while working as a inspector at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground, adding: 'It was a feature of matches in those days where people fought and argued for whatever reason. 'Those were the challenges that we were facing in the 1970s. It seemed to be very sadly the fact of life that fighting and hooliganism was the main feature of policing football matches.' Miss Lambert asked him about two pre-match meetings of police officers, dealing with planning ahead of the game. Mr Duckenfield said the first, on March 22, 1989, was chaired by his predecessor and he 'just sat there and listened'. He insisted that no minutes were taken of the meeting, and he was not given any notes after the event. Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster . Jurors also heard Mr Duckenfield intended to have a
 member Penn State fraternity defended disturbing Facebook posts unconscious female students | Kappa Delta Rho group satirical reputations => A member of the Penn State University fraternity has defended the disturbing Facebook posts of unconscious female students that led to the fraternity's suspension for a year. In an interview, the anonymous member of Kappa Delta Rho described the group as 'satirical' and accused the media of trying to ruin his fellow frat brothers' lives and reputations. This came the same day that screenshots emerged of some of the Facebook comments under posts made to a private group run by members of KDR, that included nude images of women, some of whom had passed out drunk. The screenshots show members of the group had commented referring to the women as 'sloots', saying 'I banged her lol', and then: 'Lol delete those or we will be on cnn in a week'. Scroll down for video . The photos of unconscious female students, described by police as 'disturbing', were accompanied by lewd comments in screenshots entered as evidence by police . Another screenshot of comments on one of the pictures shows a member said: '373,217 views. All from us.' 'Make that 373,218,' came the response. There were 144 members of the invite-only Facebook page. The anonymous group member provided a statement to Philadelphia magazine and gave an extensive interview. He attempted to justify the existence of the group as 'satire', that 'everyone' does it, and laid a lot of blame on the media, while calling for a return to 'higher standards of morality' and referring to the incident as 'minor'. In his statement he accused the media of attempting to 'ruin people's lives and unjustly ruin reputations' and was challenged in the interview that posting pictures of nude, unconscious women or intimate messages could ruin their lives or their reputations. At no point was the KDR brother apologetic. Nor did he seem to understand why police and the university administration were investigating the matter. 'How would it do so when it's kept within the entirely, well, it's supposed to be an entirely private group of 144 people?' he responded. Asked if that puts a lot of trust in 144 people when any one of them could repost a picture publicly, he said: 'But nobody except the one kid who snitched out this group did that … It just doesn't work that way.' He added: 'It wasn’t a legitimate concern. ... It is a brotherhood and nobody expects anyone to go and post stuff publicly or so forth and so on. It's a real disappointment that this kid went and did this.' Asked if the fraternity should accept some of the blame he responded: 'I think people should be responsible for themselves, and, I mean, I obviously had nothing to do with any of these postings, but … just think, is it smart to post this on social media? Is this ethical in regards to the people who it involves?' 'But this is not a criminal thing. It's not anyone else's business, pretty much. It's an inter-fraternity thing and that's that,' he added. He made clear that he had not posted any of the offensive material, nor commented on it, and that in retrospective, given the events, he regretted being part of the group. 'It was a satirical group. It wasn't malicious whatsoever. It wasn't intended to hurt anyone. It wasn't intended to demean anyone. It was an entirely satirical group and it was funny to some extent.' He likened the group to totalfratmove.com and 'raunchy' Snapchats that 'people send all the time'. The group was known as '2.0' and was started approximately eight months ago after its predecessor 'Covert Business Transactions' was shut down when a female student saw a topless photo of herself on a computer that had been left logged into the group. She was upset and threatened the Fraternity who closed the group. Members of Penn State's Kappa Delta Rho fraternity (pictured) posted photos to a Facebook page that showed unconscious nude female students . Asked why the group was relaunched, the group member said that its primary use was for communication within the fraternity about community service and social events. Police learned of the page when a former member of KDR, but still a member of the Facebook group, came to them and began acting as an informant. In addition to the photos of unsuspecting victims, the group was also used for drug sales and hazing. The informant told police that the drugs included marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication and some cocaine. The informant provided multiple print outs to police and said when asked about one of the pictures: 'This is the type of stuff that happens at KDR.' At a press conference on Tuesday Assistant Police Chief John Gardner said: 'The images are disturbing, I’ll tell you that. I don’t want to get into any more specifics.' Police are working with the Office of Student Conduct and Penn State's Inter-Fraternity Council, in their investigation. They are trying to get the fraternity to cooperate and help identify any members that posted photos as well as any of the victims. Possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment, though police are not ruling out other options.

 Les Ferdinand believes English football inherently racist John Terry people game | football handled terribly Terry | QPR stripped England captaincy ban | black coaches | director football offered team coaching 10 years => Les Ferdinand believes English football remains inherently racist, claiming John Terry was only saying what most people in the game think when he racially abused Ferdinand’s cousin, Anton, in 2011. Speaking to Sir Trevor Phillips as part of a Channel 4 documentary on race to be screened on Thursday, QPR’s director of football also claimed the fact that he has only once been offered a route into football management since retiring as a player did not reflect well on the game in this country either. But his views on the Terry controversy, which led to the Chelsea skipper being stripped of the England captaincy, banned for four matches and fined £220,000, are most damning. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand says that he believes English football remains inherently racist . Ferdinand claimed John Terry was saying what most people in the game think in his racial abuse incident . Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’, even though the FA charged Terry with using ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour’ which ‘included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand’ less than a fortnight after Terry was acquitted in court. Asked by Phillips for his view on the Terry incident, Ferdinand said: ‘I suppose it was disbelief really, that the England captain would use language like that on a football field, or anywhere in fact.’ But it is when Phillips then asked Ferdinand for his view on ‘how the game handled it’ that the former England striker put the situation into a wider context. Terry and Anton Ferdinand clashed during QPR's win over Chelsea in 2012 and Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, fined £220,000 and given a four-match ban after being charged by the FA . Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’ and that it could have been put to bed quicker . Weeks before the FA charge, Terry had been cleared of racial abuse at Westminster Magistrates' Court . ‘Terribly,’ he responded. ‘I think it’s a situation that could have been put to bed quite quickly. ‘And when you look at the game and the disproportion of black coaches in the game, maybe they’re not actually saying what John Terry said, but are they thinking it? Because I have to believe that.’ Phillips then asked Ferdinand how many times, in the 10 years since he stopped playing, he had been offered the opportunity to become a first-team coach. The QPR director of football says he has only been offered one first-team coaching job in 10 years . Ferdinand says he knows black players who would like to go into management but don't get opportunities . ‘Once,’ said Ferdinand. ‘Yeah once, when I came out of football I spoke to the then chairman of Bournemouth. ‘I know lots of players that I play with who’d love to go into coaching and management and they’ve done all the badges, but they just won’t get an opportunity. ‘We’ve been talking about this for 15 years now; the only difference is the venues seem to be getting better. When I first started doing it, it was in a little classroom, then we moved onto a hotel room, and now we’re at Parliament but the outcome’s still the same because we’ve not moved on.’ THINGS WE WON’T SAY ABOUT RACE THAT ARE TRUE, CHANNEL 4, THURSDAY, 9PM .
 Virgin Media Premier League | League | Sky BT screen games => Ofcom is to canvas the views of thousands of football fans as it probes a complaint by Virgin Media about the way £1.7 billion-a-year Premier League football rights are sold to broadcasters. Armchair supporters and regular match-goers are to be asked for their views as part of the regulator's inquiry. Ofcom also said it would be looking at changes in the prices charged by broadcasters for sports channels. BT Sport share the rights with Sky to broadcast Premier League football throughout the season . The regulator is in the midst of an investigation after Virgin argued that the English top flight screened fewer live matches than other top European leagues, contributing to higher prices for pay-TV packages. In an update published on Monday, it said that its probe continued to progress with no decisions reached at this stage and that it was reviewing consumer research it had recently received from Virgin Media. It added: 'Ofcom will also carry out new consumer research, which will canvas views of fans who attend matches and those who watch them on TV. Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Carragher are part of the star-studded team Sky Sports employ as pundits . 'It will look at the value viewers place on watching the Premier League. We will also be monitoring changes in retail prices of sports channels as the investigation progresses.' The fans' research will build on views already sought from football bodies, clubs, fans' groups, broadcasters and policing organisations. Virgin had argued that the latest Premier League rights auction should be suspended as Ofcom probed the process, but the regulator declined and allowed the sale to go ahead last month. Virgin Media are unhappy with the way the Premier League sell their rights for such a huge price . It resulted in Sky and BT paying a combined £5.14 billion to screen top-flight games for the 2016-2019 seasons, a 70 per cent increase on the current deal. Ofcom said prior to the auction that there was no 'urgent need' to delay it and that it was carrying out its probe 'expeditiously' given that the auctioned matches will start to be broadcast from August 2016. It said it had the power necessary to alter broadcasting arrangements before this time, should its probe find there had been an infringement of competition rules.

 Penang clue perpetrator says | Simon senior Boeing captain gained flight safety specialists | Captain Hardy spent months analysing flight data stricken aircraft | conducted miles => The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was taken on an emotional ‘last farewell’ fly-past of the pilot’s home island of Penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away, according to a British pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place. The unusual overflying of Penang is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ he says. The theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline, has gained support from one of Britain’s top flight safety specialists, David Learmount of the respected Flight International magazine and flightglobal website. Scroll down for video . Missing: MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 2014 for an approximate six-hour flight to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew . The unusual overflying of Penang, pictured, where the captain of the lost Boeing is from, is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ Captain Hardy spent six months analysing the flight data of the stricken aircraft, which disappeared almost a year ago with 239 people on board, in a bid to solve the mystery. He has concluded that the search in the vast Indian ocean being conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is. He also believes the riddle of the aircraft’s odd dog-leg flight path immediately after take-off from Kuala Lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final ‘fly-past’ of Malaysia’s Penang island to allow someone to have ‘a last emotional look.’ Captain Hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor. Details are reported in the Sunday Times. Captain Hardy says that after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 16.41 GMT on March 7 last year, flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the China Sea where four flight information regions intersect. The last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain’s was the last voice heard. Captain Hardy said the flight did something ‘quite remarkable’ by flying in and out of the airspace of Malaysia and Thailand eight times noting: ’I’ve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers.’ The captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, left, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor, right . Missing: Searchers scouring huge swathes of the world's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it . After flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards Penang, one of three turns made in quick succession. 'It took me months to work out what this was. 'The clue was Ayers Rock,’ he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of Australia. 'I have done the same manoeuvre there, to look down and get a great view. Somebody was taking a last emotional look at Penang.’ He explained: ’I thought of this at 5am, went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from.’ Noting that pilot Shah was from Penang while co-pilot Hamid was from Selangor, he said: ‘Someone did a nice long turn and looked down on Penang. It’s perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator.’ Military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 GMT heading South towards the navigation waypoint Anoko. It then flew straight for thousands of miles before, it is believed, ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Australia. Australian investigators believe the plane crashed. But Captain Hardy believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea – explaining why no wreckage has ever been found. Australian investigators said they had been in touch with Captain Hardy and described his theory as ‘credible.’ Flight magazine’s Mr Learmount said: ‘Since Capt Simon Hardy revealed in Flightglobal/Flight International his calculations about where Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is likely to have come to rest, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau – leading the MH370 search team – has spoken at length to him. ‘Despite worldwide interest in his work, nobody – yet – has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound.’
 admitted pair bar | grounds diminished attack detained indefinitely | killed Nicholas | met => A man has admitted killing the businessman cousin of Sir Ranulph Fiennes by stabbing him three times with a pair of scissors at a tapas bar. Nicholas Hunter was heard saying, 'The world is going to end tonight at midnight,' before he launched a random attack on James Fiennes. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after psychiatrists agreed he was mentally ill at the time of the attack in April last year, and was sentenced to be detained indefinitely. Attack: James Fiennes, left, was killed in a bar by mentally ill stranger Nicholas Hunter, right . Mr Fiennes, 49, was an IT consultant and entrepreneur who was the second cousin of explorer Sir Ranulph and a distant relative of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes. The Old Bailey heard that on the evening of his death he had gone for a drink at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south-west London, near the flat where he spent half of each week. He was a regular at the bar, and was described by staff and customers as a 'quiet, polite, kind and generous man', said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC. She told the court that Hunter, 37, was working for an engineering company in Barnes run by his friend Thomas Olsen. His family have a 'genetic vulnerability' to mental illness and his maternal grandfather, his nephew and his brother have all been affected, Ms Johnson said. Killing: The attack took place at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south London in April 2014 . Investigation: A police officer outside the bar shortly after the tragic incident last year . In 2005 he moved with his wife to Hong Kong to work for Cathay Pacific, but in 2011 he resigned and returned to Britain after being diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. After his baby son was born in February 2014 Hunter reported feeling paranoid, suspicious and losing touch with reality, said Ms Johnson. 'He believed people were talking about him, following him and were going to kill him,' she added. On the day of the attack, Hunter bought a a pair of scissors from Sainsbury's during his lunch break and after work he went to Mr Olsen's home and suggested going for a drink. Shortly after he arrived at the bar he announced 'out of the blue' to Mr Olsen, 'I'm going to have a sex change', then added: 'I shouldn't have told you that, I'm going to kill you, the world is going to end at midnight tonight.' Hunter then appeared to notice Mr Fiennes and called out 'Hi James', even though he had not met the victim previously. Mr Fiennes approached him and asked how they knew each other, but Hunter just said: 'James, I'm going to have to kill you.' The attacker pulled out his scissors and stabbed Mr Fiennes repeatedly in a 'frenzied and unprovoked' attack, the court heard, before guests tackled him to the ground. Mr Olsen said the 'vicious' attack made it look 'as if he was possessed', the court was told. Relatives: Mr Fiennes was a distant cousin of explorer Ranulph Fiennes, left, and actor Ralph Fiennes, right . Mr Fiennes was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment but died five hours later after his wife Caroline and their two children rushed to London from the family home in Sherborne, Dorset. Hunter, originally from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said 'I have really f***ed up my life' after dropping the scissors in the bar. He later told investigators he did not know why he had killed Mr Fiennes, but said it had something to do with the end of the world. The killer was also unable to explain why he had greeted his victim by name, saying he had 'a complete explosion in his mind'. Hunter pleaded not guilty to murdering and threatening to kill Mr Olsen, but the Crown agreed to let the charges lie on file after he admitted manslaughter. Miss Johnson said: 'The psychiatrists are agreed that at the time the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning, namely schizo-affective disorder.' In a victim impact statement, Mrs Fiennes said: 'The day I met James I knew I would marry him. I loved him then, I love him now and I will love him forever. 'He was my best friend, my soulmate, my rock or oak tree. Everything a good husband could be, James was. 'He was kind, considerate, funny, gentle, spiritual and intelligent. Above all he was loving. Everyone and anyone who knew James described him as a gentleman in every sense of the world.' In a statement read out by his barrister Isabella Forshall QC, Hunter said: 'Words alone cannot express the sorrow I feel for the catastrophic situation I have caused to those affected. I think of them and I pray for them. 'I am so very sorry for the tragedy my actions have caused.' Miss Forshall said: 'If this man hadn't become mentally ill he would have continued to live a conscientious, thoughtful and valuable life.' Sentencing Hunter to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital, judge Gerald Gordon said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that your responsibility for what you did at the time by reason of your mental illness was so substantially reduced and caused by your mental health that that is the right course. 'I should stress that I have taken into account both the ferocity of the attack and that the person you attacked was a total stranger. 'This was indeed a serious, unprovoked attack upon a complete stranger resulting in his loss of life. It occurred without your having any violent history whatsoever and as a result of your mental illness. 'I am satisfied that in the circumstances that if you are ever released, unless it is with the most careful control and monitoring, that there is a real risk of serious harm were there to be any future relapse.'
 boxing Kellie speech conference | necked seen arriving Thirties event | Kent Gay Police Association | started crack | leader party Ukip => Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney enjoyed a night out with friends at a gay police ball after receiving a standing ovation for her tearful speech at the Ukip conference. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event at the Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone on Saturday. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent. Hundreds danced the night away at the Kent Gay Police Association Charity Ball which raised money for transgender organisation TGPals and the Bluebells Children’s Short Break Centre. Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney was seen arriving at Kent Gay Police Association Charity Ball on Saturday with two friends . Alan Pughsley, the new Chief Constable of Kent, showed his support by attending the event which saw a cabaret performance from Lola Lasagne as well as a disco. Ms Maloney completed her look for the evening with black heels, layered gold necklace, black handbag and understated make-up. The twice-married 61-year-old, who underwent surgery in November last year to make her face appear more feminine, is almost two years into her transition period to change gender. As a boxing promoter she helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion. The longtime Ukip supporter was praised by Nigel Farage on Saturday as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent . Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'. She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide. 'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event with friends . Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004. At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong. 'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise. 'I had to come to terms with myself and accept that I was a transsexual. It is something I hid and something I fought. 'I wanted to transition very quietly, but unfortunately my transition is probably one of the most public events of 2014.' Ms Maloney (right) was close to tears as she read a poem about a transsexual and was praised by leader Nigel Farage (left with Ms Maloney) as proof that the party was 'open to everyone' Ms Maloney was warmly received by Ukip members as she said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues.

 Iran | hostile women Iran remain unrelenting | groups => (CNN)Earlier this month, Shahindokht Molaverdi, Iran's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, led an official delegation to the United Nations in New York to attend the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In her March 11 speech to the commission, Molaverdi said that "the Islamic Republic of Iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status...on its agenda." Molaverdi described the significant progress Iranian women have made in education and science, citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women's rights. There was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including Iran's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving Iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment. Unfortunately, Molaverdi's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality. On the day she delivered her speech, Amnesty International released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before Iran's parliament that would further restrict women's rights. One would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed "traditional" families in society. The other would "further entrench gender-based discrimination, particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children," Amnesty said. A day later, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, released his fourth report to the U.N. Human Rights Council describing the dire state of human rights in the country. His report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that Human Rights Watch and others had raised during Iran's 2014 Universal Periodic Review, a review of every U.N. state's human rights record every four years by the Human Rights Council. The sobering reality, all too familiar to Molaverdi, is that Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators. The proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women's rights in recent years. To many, the discrepancy between what Molaverdi said in her speech, and what women face in Iran, smacked of diplomatic subterfuge. Activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women's rights in Iran, and called out Molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that Iranian women face. Yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that Molaverdi, who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women's rights at home, and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for Iran's beleaguered rights activists. Just two days before the U.N. session, Iran's conservative Kayhan daily, thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, published an article that showed just what Iran's women's rights activists are up against. The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U.N. commission, describing its notion of "gender equality" as "unacceptable to the Islamic Republic." The article accused Molaverdi of "negligence" for participating in events that could damage Iran's reputation and interests, and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran's security and intelligence agencies. What's striking about Kayhan's attack is that Iran's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups, including women's rights activists. Groups like the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women, were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious "national security" grounds. But those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting. Anyone who fails, willingly or unknowingly, to heed their threats may face reprisals, as several activists who attempted to attend similar U.N. events in previous years found out. Yet Kayhan's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women's groups in Iran as they continue to challenge the state's monopoly on the women's rights narrative. While Iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution, their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education, health care, and birth control. The image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by Iran's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many Iranian women today. So while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what Molaverdi said at the United Nations, and what Iranian women face, let us not lose sight of another reality: the paradox that exists in Iran between the state's regressive laws and policies against women, and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied. That effort, at the very least, deserves our respect.

 reception 000 children start Year 1 | Nick Gibb councils child guidance schools right | barriers => Children born in the summer should be allowed to start school later in the year if they struggle with lessons, an education minister has admitted. Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child'. It follows warnings from campaigners that some local authorities made it difficult for families who want to put off joining reception classes, raising the prospect of 250,000 children having to start in Year 1. Education minister Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child' The Department for Education issued guidance to schools and councils in July 2013 and last December making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group. Summer-born children can wait until the September after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop. And it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be 'no barrier' to the child then starting in reception class. The rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school, do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university. But some councils are still sending youngsters straight into Year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were 'exceptional' circumstances. In one high profile case, mother Rosie Dutton is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started. Battle: Rosie Dutton, 30, is demanding her daughter Olivia is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four . Department for Education guidance allows parents to delay their child's schooling until the September after their fifth birthday. This policy, updated last spring, is designed to help children with birthdays between April 1 and August 31. This is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘An increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school. 'There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class'. But some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into Year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception. Bracknell Forest Council says: ‘If you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age... starting in a Reception class following a child’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances.’ Reading Borough Council warns: ‘You will need to apply for a place in Year 1. ‘However, the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year.’ Olivia Dutton, from Staffordshire, was due to start primary school last September, weeks after her fourth birthday, but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months. Mrs Dutton believes her daughter was 'not ready for school', and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into Year 1 because she was held back. Now she is fighting to allow Olivia to start in the reception class, and will hear if she has been successful in April. Mr Gibb told MPs that there had to be 'flexibility' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year. Giving evidence to the education select committee, he said: 'The key thing is flexibility, and I think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what's in the best interests of the child.' He added: 'If a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months, and it's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following September, which is when the law says they should start, I think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what's in the best interests of the child.' He stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school. But Michelle Melson, of the Summer Born Campaign, claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened . She told the committee: 'We do have a compulsory school age in England, so children should be able to start at compulsory school age.' She added that summer-born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into Year 1. 'Parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early, prior to compulsory school age, in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools.'
 judge Terrence Berg shot | trash | targeted judge | children => A federal judge shot in the leg outside his Detroit home was trying to protect his family during a robbery attempt. Terrence Berg was taking out the trash Thursday night when two people confronted him to try to get inside his home. U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said Berg refused and was 'heroic' in protecting his family. Federal judge Terrence Berg (abogve with his family) was shot in the leg outside his Detroit home Thursday night . Berg was taking out the trash when two men tried to rob him or get into his house, at which point he blocked them to protect his family . 'True to his character, Judge Berg heroically protected his family by refusing to let the robbers inside his home, McQuade told The Detroit News. In this 2009 file photo, Berg addresses the media in Detroit . 'He took a bullet in the leg, but possibly spared his family from a worse outcome. All of his friends and former colleagues at the U.S. Attorney's Office are rooting and praying for him for a speedy and full recovery.' Berg, 55, was shortly shot after 9pm, and police believe that the men were either trying to rob him or make their way into his home. Berg's wife, Anita Sevier, says he will undergo surgery later Friday and that his injury isn't life-threatening. Nobody has been arrested in the shooting and the case has been turned over to the FBI. If Berg was targeted by the men because he is a judge they will face federal charges. The 55-year-old has been a judge for two years, and his court is in Flint. Berg served as a federal prosecutor for two decades, including briefly as head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. He was nominated to the position in April 2012 by President Barack Obama. 'The lucky thing for whoever did this, is that they didn't kill him. Because then, my goodness. I'm glad he's OK.' Berg has three children.
 police dossier new torture | Prince Nasser Khalifa posted video running Hyde Park | acting | strongly deny accusations | son King | refugee => Human rights campaigners have presented police with a 'dossier' of new evidence against a Bahraini prince accused of torture after he revealed on social media he was staying in London. Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, 27, accidentally let slip he was back in Britain on Thursday when he posted a video of himself running in Hyde Park. The prince posted the video on Instagram alongside a squadron of the Life Guards of the Household Cavalry with the caption: 'That's how it feels and sounds when you run in Hyde Park, London.' Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa posted this video of himself running in Hyde Park on Thursday . The video was captioned: 'That's how it feels and sounds when you run in Hyde Park, London' He now faces fresh calls for his arrest following a High Court ruling last year which stripped him of diplomatic immunity. A Bahraini refugee in Britain, referred to only as FF, alleged Prince Nasser was involved in the torture of detained prisoners during 2011 Arab Spring protests. Today The Independent reported human rights lawyers acting for FF have delivered a 'dossier' of new evidence to Scotland Yard in a bid to have him charged following the revelation he is visiting the capital. Previous allegations which gave rise to the diplomatic immunity row did not stick. No charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence and both he and the government of Bahrain strongly deny the accusations. The case arose after FF, who has been granted asylum in the UK, claims he was badly beaten - though not by the prince directly - and given a prison sentence after taking part in protests in the Gulf state in February 2011 which left dozens dead. Following the decision to revoke his diplomatic immunity in October last year, a spokeswoman for the Government of Bahrain said: 'As the British DPP has today affirmed, an arrest would have been improper given the absence of evidence of the conduct alleged. 'As Bahrain has never sought anonymity or sovereign immunity from the English Courts for anyone in respect of this case, it expresses no view on the DPP's statement that immunity was inappropriate. 'This has been an ill-targeted, politically-motivated and opportunistic attempt to misuse the British legal system. The Government of Bahrain again categorically denies the allegations against Sheikh Nasser.' Lawyers for Prince Nasser said: 'The allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by Prince Nasser. The presentation of the "dossier" to the police appears to be a politically-motivated and opportunistic attempt to use the British justice system once again to ventilate damaging allegations about Prince Nasser. 'FF stated last October that he intended to submit further evidence to the police, but some five months passed and nothing had been forthcoming until today. The timing of the actions of the campaigners suggests this is nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to coincide with Prince Nasser's visit to the UK and FF's lawyers' threatening earlier this week to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the UK-Bahrain naval agreement. 'The police have previously declined to investigate Prince Nasser on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence against him. The submission of this new dossier at this time coincides with other attempts by opposition activists to exploit the British justice system to influence UK-Bahraini relations.' Prince Nasser, born in May 1987, is the fourth son of the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and his second wife, Sheia bint Hasan Al-Khrayyesh Al-Ajmi of Kuwait. He was educated in Bahrain at the Ibn Khuldoon National School, before commissioning from Royal Sandhurst Military Academy in August 2006, two terms after Prince William. During his Sovereign's Parade, Prince Nasser was presented with the King Hussein Medal, awarded to the overseas officer cadet considered to be the most improved recruit. He currently serves as commander of Bahrain's Royal Guard and as president of the Bahrain Olympic Committee. Bahraini anti-government protesters wait at barriers they had set up for Saudi forces called in to prop up the monarchy against demonstrations in 2011. The barrier in the foreground reads: 'Down with Hamad' Inspired by the Arab Spring, protesters in Bahrain had initially wanted to achieve greater political freedom and equality for the Shia muslims who form the majority of the population, as opposed to the ruling Sunni royal family. However, following an attack on protesters who had gathered at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama on February 17, 2011, demonstrators began to call for an end to Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's rule. The following month 1,000 troops from Saudi Arabia and 500 troops from UAE arrived in Bahrain to quell the protests, and on March 15 the king of Bahrain declared martial law and a three-month state of emergency. A man identified only as FF was later granted refugee status in the UK, and from there, set about trying to bring charges against Prince Nasser. Claiming the prince should be held responsible for his beating and imprisonment during the turmoil, his accusations were stopped when the prince was granted diplomatic immunity. In October last year, this was overturned, creating the possibility - albeit an unlikely one - that he could be charged when travelling outside Bahrain. However, these charges collapsed due to a lack of evidence.
 Jenson Button surprised McLaren Malaysian Grand Prix Fernando | forced retire called 21 lasted double time mate | Sepang => Jenson Button was pleasantly surprised by McLaren's performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix despite the fact both he and Fernando Alonso failed to finish the race. The McLaren pair began the race with Button 17th and Alonso 18th but were involved in a battle in the middle of the pack for the first half of the race. Alonso was forced to retire, though, after being called in by his team after 21 laps while Button lasted double the amount of time as his team-mate. Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix . Fernando Alonso only lasted 21 laps in Sepang in his first race of the 2015 season . Button seen on the tail of Toro Rosso driver Carlos Sainz at the Sepang International Circuit . But Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix where he could only manage to nurse the car home. He told Sky Sports: 'I would rather this way around (being forced to retire) than get to the end and be nowhere. 'We were quicker than the Force India. The Sauber was there and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. It was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars. 'It was interesting to race with other people and a little bit unexpected. It wasn't so bad, it was just a little bit messy with the pit stop and safety car.'
 Kim Kardashian Margot Robbie | require frequent salon | indication => Everyone from Kim Kardashian and Margot Robbie to Rosamund Pike and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini have chopped off their long locks recently, making shorter hair a bona fide trend. But the rise in these shorter haircuts isn't just down to their flattering face-framing effects. According to the Sunday Times, the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is also sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are therefore more pricey to maintain. Shorter haircuts, like Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's new bob (right), are an indication that the economy is in recovery . Rosamund Pike wore a longer style in Gone Girl (left) but recently she went for the chop (right, in February) Celebrity hairdresser Stuart Phillips, whose clients have included Serena Williams and Jamie Oliver, told the newspaper that he believes shorter hairdos are a sure sign that the economy is bouncing back. He said: 'Products are flying off the shelf, more than they used to even a few months ago.' And it's not just the fact that shorter styles require more sprays and gels. The upkeep of a lob (long bob) or pixie crop is also time-consuming, with some women having to visit the salon every four to six weeks to maintain the look. Margot Robbie went from one dramatic hairstyle (left, in March 2014) to another (right, in February 2015) Jourdan Dunn (left, in July 2014) made waves when she got her chin-length lob (right, in February 2015) Kristen Stewart transformed her long auburn locks (left, in May 2014) to an equally daring short style (right, in February 2015) By contrast, women with longer hair can leave it a few months before going in to top up their trims. 'With short hair you need to keep it in shape,' explained Mr Phillips. 'With long hair, a lot of women tend to leave it months on end.' Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show. And Aussie actress Margot Robbie chose the Oscars to show off her new shorter blonde look. A-list trends may not be the best indication of a pattern in the real world, but according to hairdresser Drew Foster, who owns Foster Hair & Beauty in London's Shoreditch neighbourhood, non-famous women are also following suit. Sienna Miller traded in her hippie-chic long waves (left, in March 2014) for a side-swept lob (right, in January) Scarlett Johansson had longer locks in March 2014 (left). But now, she has a very edgy pixie cut (right, February) 'Girls are going shorter,' he told the MailOnline, adding that his salon charges about £48 for a bob, with women tending to come in every six weeks to maintain the style. But Mr Foster feels that the trend is more a sign of modernity than of economic change, since women visit salons even during a recession because they see it as a way of treating themselves. In any case, he says he's definitely a fan of the new It-style. He said: 'It used to be that girls had long hair and men had short. 'Finally it's 2015 and things have shifted - and I think that's very exciting.' It's not just hair that gets shorter during a recovery - rising hemlines are also an indication that the economy is on the up. And judging by this year's London Fashion Week shows, where labels including Topshop, Julien Macdonald and Giles showcased leg-baring A-line minis, it's a trend that is here to stay.
 Jenny removed rare | cramps | bloating irritable | appendix jelly cancerous | disease pseudomyxoma peritonei Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn | colon spleen gall bladder ovaries fallopian tubes appendix belly button liver diaphragm | produce mucus abdomen | invades causing => Jenny Ramage, 35, had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . Over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation, surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from Jenny Ramage's cancer-ravaged body. One by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity. Her right colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety. Parts of her liver and diaphragm followed. The drastic operation, dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries', left Ms Ramage with a 14-inch scar running down the centre of her body - her 'survival trophy'. She repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps. And she was repeatedly dismissed, the finger pointed at period pains, bloating, appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome. But the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading Ms Ramage's body. A doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix, which had burst, and covered her internal organs with jelly-like cancerous cells. Experts diagnosed the rare disease pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) - the same disease which claimed the life of Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn. She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery. Ms Ramage, now 35, and from Bristol, said: 'The scar doesn't really bother me - I see it as a survival trophy. 'I have been very lucky, I have made a full recovery. 'There's nothing I can't do, nothing I can't eat or drink. 'But obviously my fertility was compromised, but I still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time.' Ms Ramage's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular. In late summer of that year, she became very constipated and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side, around her appendix. She later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides. Surgeons removed her colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver, kidney and diaphragm . She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery . She went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion. 'I kept on being fobbed off and told it was IBS, they didn't really know what was wrong with me,' she said. 'One day I took myself to A&E, because I thought I might have appendicitis. 'They said it was probably just wind, and so I felt silly, as if I was a hypochondriac.' The cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test. She said: 'Then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts, so I had scans which showed I did have cysts on my ovaries. 'But it turns out that's part and parcel of the disease. 'Then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there. 'When I came around after the procedure, I saw little white spots on the pictures, all over my bladder, uterus and bowel. They were everywhere in my body. Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn died from the rare disease in Switzerland in January 1993 . 'But after that, I didn't hear anything, so I thought it had just been the ovarian cysts, which were removed. 'I was still feeling funny and not well, but I thought it must be nothing. 'I went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing, but about 30 minutes later I got a frantic call from him. 'He said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before I left. 'He had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots, luckily he'd seen them. 'For noticing them, I owe him my life really. It all happened very quickly after that.' Ms Ramage went under the knife at Basingstoke Hospital, one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating PMP. 'They discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the CT scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere, from my diaphragm, right down to my bladder,' she said. The 35-year-old now lives a normal life. But she faces the prospect of not being able to have children, after her fallopian tubes were removed . 'They removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen, half my large bowel, my appendix, gall bladder, ovaries and fallopian tubes, the peritoneum, a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm. 'They scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus. 'They then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells.' The organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare cancer, affecting around one in 500,000 people a year. It typically begins in the appendix, presenting as a small growth, known as a polyp. In more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel, the ovary or bladder. The polyp eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has orginated. The disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum. The cancerous cells produce mucus, which collects in the abdomen as a jelly-like fluid called mucin. That fluid invades the abdominal cavity, causing tumours to spread. There are a number of possible origins of PMP, but the most common source is appendix cancer. There is no
 girls ISIS | families => (CNN)Turkey has arrested a person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday. This person was working for a country that is part of an international anti-ISIS coalition, Cavusoglu said. Separately, a Turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the suspect is not Turkish, and is not a citizen of the country for which he was working. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? Britain's Foreign Office on Thursday released a statement about the arrest. "We are aware that an arrest has been made by the Turkish National Police and that the Metropolitan Police have informed the families of the three girls," the statement read. "There has been close cooperation between ourselves and the Turkish authorities, and the Foreign Secretary is in regular contact with his Turkish counterpart. As soon as the UK received this information it was acted upon appropriately." Girls' ISIS checklist: Makeup, underwear . CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report from London.

The Prince of Wales filmed a video about the important of taking part in the world's biggest environmental event, Earth Hour, this weekend and proved he's a proud grandfather with a sweet snap of him holding Prince George placed on a table in the background . The photograph shows doting Prince Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever in a white sun hat and dungarees as he points into the distance . The family snap, which was seemingly taken in the warmer summer months, shows doting Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever wearing a white sun-hat and navy blue dungarees as he seemingly points to something in the distance. In the video, Charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual Earth Hour and turn off our lights this weekend. The photo, of Kate and William, who are expecting their second child next month, first son, is rather fitting; in the message, he urges people to work to save the planet 'not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren'. The new photo, which takes pole position in the video, comes after reports that the monarch is frustrated that he doesn't see his grandson very often. In the video, Charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual Earth Hour and turn off our lights this weekend and how important it is for the future of our families . Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom the Duke recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ A source told the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. The video comes in the same month as reports that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince's life . Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Little George, who will soon become a big brother after his mother gives birth next month, hasn't been seen in public since February. Whilst the grandfather and grandson were pictured together at the young royal's christening, the new photo is the only one of Prince Charles and Prince George that we have seen alone . Little George will soon become a big brother after his mother gives birth next month . The tiny tot was seen being carried through St. Lucia's tiny airport and boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique. Kate, who was almost seven months pregnant at the time, and William were on the island to celebrate Carole Middleton's 60th birthday on the 31st January, as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April. Prince William today told wellwishers ‘not long now’, as his pregnant wife Kate stepped out for her last official outing before she gives birth. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visiting the Stephen Lawrence Centre at the start of a day of engagements in South London. Kate, who is due to give birth late next month, looked radiant in a £1,500 fuschia-pink Mulberry coat as they toured the building named after the murdered teenager with his mother, now Baroness Doreen Lawrence of Clarendon, 62, and his younger brother Stuart, 37.

 toilet zones | uses microbial fuel stacks toilets feed energy | Bristol | £ 600 900 set => A prototype toilet that generates 'everlasting' electricity from urine has been launched near a university bar. The scientists behind the 'pee-power' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much-needed electricity to refugee camps. The technology uses microbial fuel stacks in the toilets, which feed on urine, creating biochemical energy that can be turned into electricity. Scroll down for video . A prototype toilet that generates 'everlasting' electricity from urine has been launched near at a university bar (stock image used). The scientists behind the 'pee-power' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much-needed electricity to refugee camps . The urinal is the result of a partnership between researchers at the University of the West of England in Bristol and Oxfam. The units contain bacteria that breaks down the chemicals in urine, in the process releasing energy in the form of electricity which is stored on a capacitor within a fuel cell. 'The microbial fuel cells (MFC) work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance,' explained Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos. 'The MFC is, in effect, a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy. 'This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product that will be in plentiful supply.' It is located near the students' union at the university's Frenchay campus and researchers will be hoping for brisk business at closing time. Students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting. The research team is led by Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos, of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at UWE Bristol, who is an expert at harnessing power from unusual sources using microbial fuel cells. 'We have already proved that this way of generating electricity works,' the professor said. 'Work by the Bristol BioEnergy Centre hit the headlines in 2013 when the team demonstrated that electricity generated by microbial fuel cell stacks could power a mobile phone. 'This exciting project with Oxfam could have a huge impact in refugee camps. 'The microbial fuel cells work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance. 'The microbial fuel cell is in effect a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy used for microbial growth, and converts that directly into electricity - what we are calling urine-tricity or pee power. 'This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product that will be in plentiful supply.' The urinal on the university campus resembles toilets used in refugee camps by Oxfam to make the trial as realistic as possible. The technology that converts the urine in to power sits underneath the urinal and can be viewed through a clear screen. The toilet is located near the students' union at Bristol university's Frenchay campus and researchers will be hoping for brisk business at closing time.Students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting . Andy Bastable, head of water and sanitation at Oxfam, said: 'Oxfam is an expert at providing sanitation in disaster zones, and it is always a challenge to light inaccessible areas far from a power supply. 'This technology is a huge step forward. Living in a refugee camp is hard enough without the added threat of being assaulted in dark places at night. The potential of this invention is huge.' They hope the abundant, free supply of urine will make the device practical for aid agencies to use in the field. Prof Ieropoulos added: 'One microbial fuel cell costs about £1 ($1.5) to make, and we think that a small unit like the demo we have mocked up for this experiment could cost as little as £600 ($900) to set up, which is a significant bonus as this technology is in theory everlasting.'
 Steve Clarke drew 0 0 | FA | Parade | said Brighton Tuesday => Reading must dust themselves down and turn their attention back to league matters when they host Brighton in the npower Championship on Tuesday night. The Royals face an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford next week following Saturday's goalless draw in Yorkshire. But before that Steve Clarke's side must attempt to ease any fears of being sucked into the Championship relegation battle with two tough matches, the midweek visit of the Seagulls followed by a trip to promotion-chasing Watford on Saturday. Reading manager Steve Clarke watches on from the dugout as Reading drew 0-0 with Bradford on Saturday . Reading captain Alex Pearce broke his nose during the FA Cup last-eight clash . 'Between now and the replay there's two important games for both sides,' said Clarke. 'We want the same resolve and desire on Tuesday night, and hopefully a couple of goals and three points.' Clarke must decide whether to risk centre-half Alex Pearce, who suffered a broken nose in the bruising encounter at Valley Parade. 'I was delighted with the attitude from the players, it was top class,' added Clarke. 'I thought it was typified by our captain coming back on with a broken nose, nothing was going to stop him. His nose is miles over here somewhere. But he went back on, a proper centre-half. 'It would have been easy to say "I'm not going back on", but no, Alex said "patch me up, straighten it later" and he was straight back on the pitch.' The central defender played on after being patched up on the sideline at Valley Parade . Clarke said that Pearce's attitude typified his side and urged more of the same against Brighton on Tuesday . Brighton, a point and a place below Reading in 19th, will be without striker Sam Baldock who looks set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Kazenga LuaLua is likely to come into the starting line-up in Baldock's absence and the winger expects a stern test against the Royals. 'It's going to be a tough game for us, but every match is going to be tough now,' he told the club website. 'Reading are not far from where we are in the league, but it's still going to be a very difficult game. 'They've a powerful team that has a lot of pace and they've got some good wingers as well. With the squad they have, they may feel they should be in a higher position, but this league is very tough and competitive.'
 slogan killer | advert 1988 executive Dan Wieden admitted borrowed murderer firing squad | appeared end Gary words let | said | described 20th => Nike’s ‘Just do it’ slogan is undoubtedly a killer line – and now it’s been revealed that the inspiration for it came from an actual killer. The phrase, first used in a Nike advert in 1988, was pitched to the firm by advertising executive Dan Wieden, who admitted that it was borrowed from something a Utah murderer uttered as he faced a firing squad. The condemned man in question was Gary Gilmore, who was sentenced to death in 1977 for robbing and murdering two men in Utah the previous year. Scroll down for video . Nike’s ‘Just do it’ slogan is undoubtedly a killer line – and now it’s been revealed that the inspiration for it came from an actual killer . The tagline 'Just do it', which has become synonymous with the Nike brand, first appeared in 1988 at the end of an advert featuring 80-year-old runner Walt Stack (pictured) Gary Gilmore (pictured) uttered the words 'let's do it' before he was executing by firing squad for two Utah murders in 1977. The phrase inspired one of the most successful advertising slogans of all time . He chose to be executed by firing squad and it was reported that he said ‘let’s do it’ in the moments before he died. Mr Wieden, speaking at an advertising conference in Cape Town in February, said that he recalled this line in 1988 just before he had a crunch marketing campaign meeting with Nike bosses, and decided to suggest a slightly altered version as a slogan. This week Mr Wieden, co-founder of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, repeated the story to Dezeen magazine. He described how he was worried that an upcoming series of five TV adverts lacked cohesion, because they all had a different feel to them. He felt they needed a tagline to tie them all together. His company had been parachuted in by Nike to help them counter-attack rivals Reebok, who had just announced bigger profits. Dan Wieden (pictured) revealed that the slogan 'Just do it' was borrowed from the last words of Utah murderer Gary Gilmore . Mr Wieden said: ‘We… came up with five different 30 second spots. The night before [a meeting with Nike] I got concerned because… there wasn't an overlying sensibility to them all. Some were funny, some were solemn. So I thought… we need a tagline to pull this stuff together. ‘I wrote about four or five ideas. I narrowed it down to the last one, which was "Just do it". The reason I did that one was funny because I was recalling a man in Portland. ‘He murdered a man and a woman, and was put before a firing squad. And they asked him if he had any final thoughts and he said: "Let's do it." And for some reason I went: "Now damn. How do you ask for an ultimate challenge that you are probably going to lose, but you call it in?" So I thought, well, I didn't like "Let’s do it" so I just changed it to "Just do it".’ At first, he recalled, Nike hated the idea, but he won them round and the slogan appeared at the end of an advert featuring 80-year-old runner Walt Stack. It is now one of the most famous slogans in the world, described by Campaign magazine as ‘arguably the best tagline of the 20th century’.
 study carried University Manchester | found redundant trust | years job | James => Being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards, according to a study. Losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem, the researchers found. It suggests that, even in later life, people can struggle to get over a firing in their life. The study was carried out by the University of Manchester. They found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others (stock image shown). People still showed the effect years after losing their job. 'Trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world,' said Dr James Laurence of the university . Study author Dr James Laurence, from the University of Manchester, said: ‘People’s willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime. ‘However, this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred. ‘Society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that. ‘Even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job. No matter how good your CV, it's your voice that may actually help you land the job. Researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent, thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same. They also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates' own written pitches. The new study by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Professor Nicholas Epley and PhD candidate Juliana Schroeder also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate's voice. ‘This has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits, from health and happiness, to social cohesion, efficient democratic governance and economic development.’ The study, which was published in the journal Social Science Research, involved data from almost 7,000 British adults followed as part of the National Child Development Study of adults born in March 1958. Responses from 1991, when the individuals were 33, were compared with responses from 2008, when they were 50, noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy, downsizing or restructuring in the period in between. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off. Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent. To find out how long the effect of redundancy continues, the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off: ages 33-41 (but not 41-50); 41-50 (but not 33-41) and both 33-41 and 41-50. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off (stock image shown). Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent . ‘We observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust,’ said Dr Laurence. ‘Importantly, individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33-41 but not 41-50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50. ‘This is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred.’ He added: ‘The greater the attachment to employment, the stronger the negative effect of displacement. ‘A range of mediators, such as physical health, mental well-being, and personal efficacy, do not appear to account for the effect. ‘That the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences.’
 Adam Johnson set start Sunderland game charge Saturday | winger suspicion activity girl | 23 | manager => Adam Johnson is set to start for Sunderland in Dick Advocaat’s first game in charge at West Ham on Saturday. The winger returned to training on Wednesday after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. The Black Cats took the decision to allow Johnson to return after his bail was extended to April 23. Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, has had his bail extended until April 23 . New Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat has confirmed that Adam Johnson will be available for selection . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . And the 27-year-old flew to London with the rest of the squad last night ahead of the game at Upton Park. Advocaat has worked with Johnson at the Academy of Light this week and he took part in a full-scale practice match on Thursday. When asked during his unveiling press conference if Johnson would play at West Ham, Advocaat said: ‘Everyone who is training is available for selection.’ Former Manchester City player Johnson has had his suspension lifted following the extension of his bail . The 27-year-old winger could feature for new manager Dick Advocaat after his suspension was lifted . Advocaat has inherited a side one point and one place above the drop zone. The Dutchman, however, has never been relegated in his 27-year managerial career and does not intend to add demotion to his CV at Sunderland. ‘I have never been relegated and always have the feeling that I will never go down,’ he said. ‘So I don’t really want to talk about relegation.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
 neighbors harmed smoke | ordered inside family | Superior lawsuit => A temporary order by a Superior Court judge is keeping a man from smoking inside his home in the District of Columbia - even though it's completely legal. WJLA-TV reports that Edwin Gray's next door neighbors in northeast Washington have filed a civil suit claiming they're being harmed by smoke that sneaks into their home through a hole in the basement. The family moved into the home next to Gray last year and have one child, and another on the way. No smoking zone: Edwin Gray has been ordered not to smoke inside his home, which his family has owned for the past 50 years . Complaints: The temporary injunction was ordered by a Superior Court judge after one of Gray's neighbors in northeast Washington, DC filed a lawsuit saying smoke was leaking into their home . A judge issued a temporary injunction last week saying neither Gray nor any family or guests may smoke in the home the family has owned for 50 years. The family has vowed to fight the order. In court filings and a statement, the neighbors say they tried to work with Gray and his sister Mozella Johnson, but that the mediation attempts failed and they decided to file the suit. 'You want me to stop what I've been doing in my house, all my life,' Gray remarked. In addition to seeking an injunction on smoking at the house, the neighbors are also asking for $500,000 in damages. The lawsuit does set a precedent for other complaints in the DC area. A columnist for the Washington Post said the Gray lawsuit could lead to hundreds of others, from neighbors hoping to control the activities of other residents. 'We were floored,' Gray's sister, Johnson, said. 'If this judge has done this, who will be next? What other neighbor will be next?'
 drugs Range difficult face 10 years | 42 year old entertainment company Society aired story | set => A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars. Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs. The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs . 'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook. 'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.' A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month. The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney. 'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote. 'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.' The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story about her drug dealing . Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash. Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society. The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about. A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 where police found drugs, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash . Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat. 'I believed so much in the concept I had developed with Urban Society, that I made the decision to liquidate everything I owned and worked for my whole life to fund the business,' she wrote. She said in the first year of business, it ended up costing her just under $250,000 - a sum she hadn't factored and ended up borrowing money from a friend. 'I then needed to pay that money back. One thing led to another and I had two choices: a) find a way to pay back the money or b) fold the company,' she said. 'After all the blood, sweat and tears and my whole life's work in this company, I wasn't about to loose (sic) everything so I did what I had to do to get myself out of a situation where I felt I was trapped.' Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat . Stockbridge said the people closest to her weren't aware of what she was doing and claims it wasn't anything to do with greed. She hit back at comments made by Daily Mail Australia that her staff were left high and dry when she was arrested in 2013. 'Naturally, because I was arrested, I couldn't pay them. There was no-one who could have done this for me as it would have involved chasing money. They took everything else off me,' she wrote. 'I’m sick of hearing comments insinuating that I didn't pay them on purpose. I do intend to pay them back that last week's pay and I am chasing outstanding money and getting into trouble for it. 'It was never my intention to hurt anyone. I was just trying to fix a bad situation and I didn't do a very good job of it. Now I will pay for that error of judgement for the rest of my life.'
 Guo 29 Zhejiang | application process high | male cheerleaders | Korea => Guo Hong, 29, always has at least three or four male students for her cheerleading classes, which is highly unusual in China . There aren't many things which could entice groups of male students in China to sign up for cheerleading classes - but the 'most gorgeous' teacher in the country is certainly one of them. Guo Hong, 29, started off teaching two classes at Zhejiang University in eastern China one semester ago but is now running twice as many. Though considered much more suitable for female students, it is proving very popular with many male ones also, no doubt keen to catch the eye of their beautiful instructor. The multiple national dance champion's class is so popular you now have to make it through a strict three stage application process to get in as the numbers applying are so high. Even students who haven't been selected have been known to turn up for Guo's lessons, which are the most popular PE classes at the university. At least three or four male would-be cheerleaders are always lining up for lessons, which is highly unusual in conservative China. Not long ago Korea's 'most beautiful PE teacher' was a hot topic online, with fans posting about her 'angel's face with a devil's body' and lamenting 'it's such a pity she's other people's PE teacher.' But now China has its answer in Guo, after students posted pictures online which went viral, saying: 'Look at this, we definitely have the prettiest PE instructor in the country.' Her classes draw observers from the sidelines and participants who have already completed their credits for PE but have joined the course anyway. Scroll down for video . Students who haven't been selected have been known to turn up for Guo's lessons, which are very popular . Pharmacy major, Xu Qianhao, says that he is curious about this course and saw it as a fresh challenge. Even with the huge subscription rate he was able to still get through to secure his place. Xu said that the lessons are exciting and demanding and after one semester he feels he has a much better sense of coordination and the physical demands are greater than he expected. Jiang is a Resources, Environment and Urban Planning student who has signed up for two semesters of the cheerleading course. When asked why he replied, red faced: 'When I first applied it was because other students said that boys were able to get high final exam scores. 'I didn't expect that each lesson will be led from start to finish by the teacher which is very interesting. Also the teacher often chooses songs that are nice so I chose this course for two semesters.' Guo with her many trophies and awards. She used to run two classes but now takes four because of demand . Guo said: 'I started artistic gymnastics when I was four years old and have been involved in sports since then. 'I am a technical cheerleading national champion, competitive aerobics national champion, miss aerobics national champion so essentially all the courses that I trained in at university I have achieved national champion status in. 'However at present I most like cheerleading.' Zhejiang University's Cheerleading group was created by Guo after she arrived. At the time she had to recruit members one at a time as well as arrange the weekly training sessions. 'Usually we train twice a week but when we are coming up to a competition we will train four to five times a week. 'The courses are free because I enjoy participating myself.'
 people Honduras | team rubble monkey believe thousands | American explorer => A team hunting for the legendary 'lost city' of Ciudad Blanca in Honduras has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old, according to National Geographic. Researchers believe the complex of plazas, mounds, a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace. It prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the White City, which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and Spanish explorers around the la Mosquita area of jungle in Honduras for hundreds of years. Some people call it the White City Of Gold, after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador Hernando Cortes to King Charles V of Spain in 1526. Since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization, rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding Indiana Jones'. One such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the White City of the Monkey God, and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity, symbolized by a large statue. Theodore Morde, writing of his adventures in US magazine The American Weekly, said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city. Locals even told him that one 'monkey god' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half-human, half-chimp children. The children were then hunted for revenge. Local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist, according to a Honduran media report. Morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the Chorotegas, and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939-40. But Morde never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954. Scroll down for video . A sign of history? This block of stone could be a remnant of a temple built in the Lost City of Honduras thousands of years ago . Incredible: The aerial shots taken by National Geographic show luscious forestland where the City Of The Monkey God once thrived . However, despite archaeologists' following attempts to detect man-made structures - whether they be from Ciudad Blanca, The White City of the Monkey God or elsewhere - have been unsuccessful. Until now. Traveling into uncharted territory last month, a National Geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old. The National Geographic's Douglas Preston wrote: 'The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. 'They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures. 'The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be 'a were-jaguar,' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. 'Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.' According to Theodore Morde, stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city's central temple, which was built in the shape of the monkey God. He described the myth: 'One day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an Indian village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens. 'They took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children. 'From this union came, however, not human nor partly human children but the small Urus or monkeys.' Discovery? American explorer Theodore Morde (left) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador Hernando Cortes centuries before. Speaking to locals, he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured (right) hiding Rama and Sita, two more Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. The Honduran monkey God is more menacing, he said . The lost city, believed to be full of gold, has merited two names based on legends. Texts cite 'la Ciudad Blanca' or 'the White City' it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones. Other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey-shaped temple. There were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half-monkey, half-human babies, warranting the name: The City Of The Monkey God. Either way, it has been sought since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. It inspired the Dance Of The Dead Monkeys, during which locals roast monkeys over a fire in an apparent act of revenge for stealing their virgins. The first mention of the city came in Hernando Cortes' fifth letter to King Charles V of Spain in 1926, when he wrote that it will 'exceed Mexico in riches'. Historians believe, based on his description, that the city was in the region of Mosquitia - which was then, and remains now, impenetrably dangerous. '…I have trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces,' he wrote, 'and of powerful chiefs ruling over them, and of one in particular, called Hueitapalan, and in another dialect Xucutaco, about which I possessed information six years since, having all this time made inquiries about it, and ascertained that it lies eight or ten days' march from that town of Trujillo, or rather between fifty and sixty leagues. 'So wonderful are the reports about this particular province, that even allowing largely for exaggeration, it will exceed Mexico in riches, and equal it in the largeness of its towns and villages, the density of its population, and the policy
 London Jews | Advertising Standards ASA concluded poster breach rules | Danny => The poster for play, Bad Jews, which has been banned by London Underground . Adverts for a Jewish play which received five-star reviews in one of the religion's newspapers have been banned from the London Underground because they 'could cause offence'. Transport for London (TfL) decided that posters of Joshua Harmon's acclaimed production, Bad Jews, contravened its policy following an investigation by an advertising regulator. The poster for the comedy, which is about a family brought together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather, shows four characters in a quarrel on the floor. One complaint was made to the the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) during the play's first campaign, but the regulator concluded that the poster did not breach rules. However, TfL disagreed with the ASA's ruling and told the Evening Standard it would not clarify the precise reason for the rejection. A TfL spokesperson said in a statement: 'The advert "Bad Jews" was previously displayed on our network as our advertising contractor approved it without consulting us. 'It was subsequently submitted for display again and has been rejected as it contravened our advertising policy, which states that adverts will not be approved if they may cause widespread or serious offence.' Producer Danny Moar has blasted TfL's decision, saying it seemed like 'censorship', despite the play winning a five-star review for the Jewish Chronicle. He told the paper: 'Half the cast are Jewish, I'm Jewish, the writer is Jewish and the word "bad" in the title, in so far as it matters, doesn't mean "evil" — it means "non-observant". 'This is a form of censorship which is so weird and ironic when, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo events, everyone marched against censorship.' Producer Danny Moar (pictured right, with actor Colin McFarlane) has blasted the decision by TfL, describing it as a 'form of censorship' The play is about three cousins who have had to come together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather. It involves rows and quarrels between the family members, told in a hilarious comedy . ★★★★ ‘Exhilaratingly abrasive…A terrific family comedy’ Sunday Times . ★★★★ ‘Ferociously clever…a visceral thrill’ Evening Standard . ★★★★ ‘Hilariously, exquisitely edgy’ The Times . ★★★★ ‘Scaldingly funny’ Daily Telegraph . ★★★★ ‘Vivid, raw, brilliant.’Financial Times . ★★★★ ‘Exquisitely hilarious’ Independent . He admitted that the rejection shouldn't have too much of an impact on the show, but that they are being prevented from reaching as many people as possible. The play is due to be transferred from the St James Theatre in Victoria to the Arts Theatre on March 18. The transport company has previously rejected bus posters from Christian group, Core Issues Trust, which suggested gay people could be helped to change their sexuality. In a separate incident, Sainsburys removed all its kosher food from shelves in Holborn, central London, in August last year, over fears anti-Israeli protesters outside would attack it. The transport company decided the advert could cause 'widespread offence' after an investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) The poster was previously advertised and one complaint was received, but the advertising regulator said it did not breach their rules. However, TfL disagreed and decided it would ban the posters . The play is due to be transferred from the St James Theatre in Victoria to the Arts Theatre on March 18 .
 James 18 died single Deepcut Barracks | death November claimed | 1995 | army Pte James took life | old | new => The family of Private Cheryl James, 18, pictured, died from a single gunshot wound to the head at Deepcut Army Barracks in Surrey in 1995 . A female soldier was subjected to sexual violence before her death at Deepcut Army base in November 1995, it has been claimed. Private Cheryl James was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002. The 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head. An army investigation ruled that Pte James took her own life, while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death. Now Pte James' family want a new inquest following the discovery of new evidence which could provide a different explanation for the tragedy. Last July, the family were successful being granted a new inquest, but the hearing his being delayed by Surrey Police. The family's legal team claim that new ballistics evidence as well as claims of bullying and sexual violence in the weeks leading up to Pte James' death. The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbigshire, north Wales died on November 27, 1995. She suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose. Ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by Pte James could have been self inflicted. Just five months before Pte James' death, Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest. The army maintained that Pte Benton took his own life in June 1995, despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range. In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London suffered two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty. Pte James was one of four young army recruits to have died at Deepcut Army Barracks, pictured . Doreen and Des James , pictured, want a new inquest to find out what happened to their daughter in 1995 . On March 23, 2002, Private James Collison, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound to the chin. Once again the army insisted that another young recruit had taken their own life. Although the families of the dead soldiers believe that authorities are trying to cover up the real cause of the deaths. During the most recent hearing, Alison Foster QC told the High Court: 'We will present shocking details which will pertain only to this girl. Private Sean Benton . The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide. Private Cheryl James . The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death. Private Geoff Gray . The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area. Private James Collinson . The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. An inquest in February 2006 recorded an open verdict . 'We will be looking at the circumstances surrounding Cheryl's death including ballistics, harassment and sexual violence towards her.' Pte James' family want to have their daughter's body exhumed for a new examination which they hope prove that the young recruit did not take her own life. The 20-year-long legal battle is being supported by Liberty. Pte James' family are anxious that the new inquest into their daughter's death is opened as quickly as is reasonably possible. But Surrey Police want the inquiry delayed as the families of the three other recruits may wish to reopen their inquests. Pte James had been stationed at the controversial Deepcut Barracks near Frimley in Surrey for just 11 days at the time of her death as part of the Royal Logistics Corps. She was found on November 27, 1995 at 8.30am near her guard post. The was armed with a standard-issue SA80 rifle. Surrey Police conducted their own investigation into the death which formed part of a 44-volume case file. It included statements, documents, notes, photographs and forensic evidence. Liberty successfully managed to force Surrey Police, using the Human Rights Act, to hand over the dossier, which is central to the latest legal bid. Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: 'Cheryl died in 1995. Surrey Police held onto all the sensitive material about Cheryl’s death, refusing to hand it over to the family until 2012 – and then only under threat of litigation using the Human Rights Act. 'The content of the disclosure is shocking and it was on the basis of that evidence that the High Court ordered a fresh inquest. 'After almost 20 years her case is finally ready to proceed. 'That it should now be Surrey Police – again – that is standing in the way of the investigation by asking for the case to be delayed is deeply upsetting to Cheryl’s parents.' An independent investigation into the four deaths published in 2006 found 'clear evidence of found abuse', 'institutional failings' and a 'culture of intimidation' at Deepcut Barracks. But the report, which had been commissioned by the Ministry of Defence found that Pte James and her comrades had not been 'bullied to death' and had probably taken their own
 clubs | Raheem Sterling Wayne Rooney | Harry Kane | spells team => Sometimes I think the Premier League clubs have to remember in which country their fantastic product is played. You can already sense there is reluctance to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s suggestion that we increase the number of home-grown players in a squad from eight to 12. We will never know if our players our good enough unless they get the chance and there are still people at Premier League clubs reluctant to take that risk. Talent isn’t always as obvious as Raheem Sterling or Wayne Rooney. Harry Kane has been phenomenal in attack at Tottenham Hotspur since being given his chance to shine . Kane Wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal at Wembley . Sometimes, as with Harry Kane, it takes time to develop and that only comes with games. It’s only a year ago that some at Tottenham would have questioned whether he was Champions League quality. They’re not now, but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him. Germany have German owners and, by and large, German coaches and they’re world champions. Their clubs and football association co-operate. We don’t have such unity so it is no surprise that our international record is what it is. Kane has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the Tottenham first-team this season . FA chairman Greg Dyke’s is looking to increase the number of home-grown players in a squad from eight to 12 .

 Simone Jones underwent 9 Lexington Plastic Surgeons Manhattan heart rate | death examiner New York | health aide liposuction legs arms lift tummy | said blood clot => Simone Jones (above), 45, of Brooklyn went into cardiac arrest during an $11,000 liposuction procedure at a New York plastic surgery clinic and was pronounced dead in hospital . A woman went into cardiac arrest during an $11,000 liposuction procedure at a New York plastic surgery clinic and was pronounced dead in hospital. Simone Jones, 45, of Brooklyn underwent the operation on February 9 at Lexington Plastic Surgeons in Manhattan when her heart rate dropped. At the time, her surgery was allegedly 98 per cent complete, the plastic surgeon, Dr. Alan Bienstock told Jones' daughter, Shantay. The cause of Simone's death remains under investigation as the city medical examiner awaits test results, and Jones' family lawyer has also demanded an investigation by the Department of Health, the New York Daily News. Simone, a mental health aide and mother-of-four, had saved the funds to pay for liposuction on her legs, arms and back, a buttocks lift and a tummy tuck. Shantay, 26, said her mother was looking forward to showing off her new look. 'She was very attractive and looked young for her age and she wanted the whole package. She took pride in her appearance,' she said. As she had spoken to her mother before she had gone in for the operation that morning, Shantay said she was called by the clinic hours after her mother had checked in.

She was told there was a complication and to go to Bellevue Hospital as soon as possible. When she arrived, Dr Bienstock along with other doctors shared the news about her mother, explaining that her heart rate dropped while they were working on her buttocks. 'Ms. Jones, an otherwise healthy woman went in for an ambulatory procedure and apparently her vital signs were not being properly monitored so as to allow this tragedy to occur,' said the family's lawyer, Scott Rynecki. Shantay said she never got a clear answer on what happened and that Dr Bienstock said it could have been a blood clot among other possibilities. Shantay Jones, 26, Simone's daughter said she never got a clear answer on what happened and that Dr Bienstock said it could have been a blood clot among other possibilities (above an operating room in Lexington Plastic Surgeons) When the clinic called the following day to express sympathy for the family's loss, Simone's aunt suggested the money be returned, but Dr Bienstock never got back in touch with them regarding it. Until they have answers, Shantay and her family will continue demanding for clarity concerning her mother's death. She said: 'I want answers. We are going to fight for her because she would have fought for us.' Shantay was told there was a complication and to go to Bellevue Hospital (file photo above) as soon as possible.

 rides Ryanair win | 16 | Carlingford | Betfred Cup Friday => If Uxizandre’s Ryanair Chase success on Thursday is to be AP McCoy’s last Festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory. But, typically, at least for the time being, it will be confined to the recesses of the McCoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his Cheltenham career on Friday afternoon. Over breakfast, he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction, you don’t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his Betfred Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm. One thing is certain, the mood will be better at the McCoy table than it was 24 hours earlier. AP McCoy rides Uxizandre to victory in Thursday’s Ryanair Chase for his 31st Cheltenham Festival win . McCoy celebrates with the trophy after his first Festival win of 2015 with his Peadar McCoy by his side . Wife Chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been ‘melancholy’ after two fruitless days amid, no doubt, a creeping fear that things were not going her husband’s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages. McCoy's wife Chanelle admitted a ‘melancholy’ had come over AP after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16-1 shot . All that changed when 16-1 shot Uxizandre, not even the first string of his trainer Alan King in the Ryanair Chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor, galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of Ma Filleule. Even the crowd seemed stunned at first. The roar took time to grow but by the time McCoy had returned to the winners’ enclosure, they were raising three cheers. After being joined on the winner’s podium by Chanelle, his father Peadar and boss JP McManus, McCoy said: ‘Cheltenham is a very special place. It is where every jockey wants to win and I am no different. These are the days I am going to miss that’s for sure. ‘I had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers. ‘You have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins. That is how my life has normally been, so there is no point changing this week. ‘I was all right. You can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse — and this horse is very well. ‘I was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him.’ McManus, his ally for a decade, looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts. He said: ‘It is great to have a man like AP on your side. I am just so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival and that we provided it for him makes it even better. JP McManus, AP's ally for a decade, was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win . JP said: 'I am so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better' ‘I remember years ago Christy Roche rang me and said ‘‘Have you seen this young lad ride? He should be handicapped, not the horses’’. ‘I respect AP and love everything he does on and off the racecourse.’ McCoy will wear the green and gold McManus colours on John Kiely-trained Carlingford Lough, as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the Festival — Hargam, Princely Conn and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase which carries his own name. McManus has not ruled out the dream Gold Cup ending . He said: ‘Carlingford Lough has a chance in a very open race. I was hoping he might be good enough. ‘He had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious. He improved from the run in the Lexus Chase at Christmas and has a good 10-1 chance of winning in an open Gold Cup.’ There are definitely plenty of dangers — about 17 of them — as few can be ruled out. Defending champion Lord Windermere aims to win at his third consecutive Festival and provide his trainer, Jim Culloty, with a first win under rules since the week after last year’s Gold Cup. A win for last year’s fourth and the form horse of the race, favourite Silviniaco Conti, would also put his trainer Paul Nicholls, who additionally saddles Sam Winner, level with the late Tom Dreaper as a record five-time race winner. McCoy stands with Carlingford Lough after their win in the Hennessey Gold Cup at Leopardstown on February 8. He'll be riding the same mount in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday shortly after 3.20pm . But his lack of course form is a worry and, the chaotic and close nature of last year’s finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners; horses like Noel Meade’s Road To Riches, Oliver Sherwood’s Many Clouds and Jonjo O’Neill’s Holywell, who at one point looked like being McCoy’s mount. Also in that category is the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, behind whom there is growing confidence, and Carlingford Lough. But if McManus acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves, he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon- to-retire jockey. ‘We’ve had him cloned,’ he joked.

 fight Pacquiao Mayweather Nacho 45 cent | Las Vegas | visited NFL gym Los Angeles | $ => With just over a month to go until the mega fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, legendary trainer Nacho Beristain believes that 'Pac-Man' has a chance of winning - and gives him a 45 per cent chance. Juan Manuel Marquez's trainer is a fan of the hard-hitting Filipino and likes his intelligence, hand speed and ability to throw combinations. With Mayweather's defence the best in the world, Beristain knows it'll be a tough ask but thinks that if Pacquiao boxes smart then he has an opportunity. Manny Pacquiao (left) and Tim Tebow pose for a photo after the NFL quarterback visited the boxer . 'I believe that Pacquiao has 45 per cent of a chance; Mayweather is the favorite but by very little,' Beristain told ESPN Deportes. 'I always liked more Pacquiao for commercial style, which people pay with pleasure to see him fight, and the other [Mayweather], we already know it, a defensive, style that is kind of weird.' 'On paper who looks the best is Mayweather,' Beristain added. 'The knockout by Juan Manuel of Manny [in 2012]. But Pacquiao has many things in its favour – the speed, and being a smart fighter. Even though people think otherwise, he knows when to shoot his combinations.' Nacho Beristain (right) reckons Pacquiao has a 45 per cent chance of beating Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas . Juan Manuel Marquez's trainer is a fan of the Filipino but thinks he will need to fight smart to win the bout . With training heavily ongoing for the two fighters, Pacquiao was visited by NFL quarterback Tim Tebow at the gym in Los Angeles. The two athletes have a lot in common, with both of them strong Christians and being born in the Philippines. Tebow took to Instagram to show the stars spending time together during his training session. He posted: 'Awesome being with my Filipino and Christian brother.' Floyd Mayweather is also in full flow with his training regime but took some time out to post a photo where he looked relaxed ahead of the upcoming $300million fight. The two athletes share a lot in common as strong Christians and both being born in the Phillipines . Floyd Mayweather looked relaxed as he posed for a photo as the boxer looks to keep his 100% record going .
 alleged spies Iraq | images execution published social media | Baghdad government condemned death | week ISIS => Shocking photographs showing the bloody beheading of four alleged spies in Iraq have been released by Islamic State. The images, given the disturbing title 'Harvesting of Spies', were taken in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin and published on social media. According to the captions, the four men were accused of being spies for the Baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an Islamic court. Depraved: The images of the execution were taken in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin and published on social media . Unusually for an ISIS public execution, no residents appear to have been allowed to witness the killings, despite them being carried out in a public place . Kneeling in matching black jumpsuits, the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs. ISIS fighters, three with their faces covered with balaclavas and another wearing a baseball cap, are pictured posing behind their victims with sharp knives. An ISIS official, carrying a machine gun and with his index finger pointing to the sky, is shown coordinating the execution. Dressed in a long tunic and wearing a head scarf, the man appears to be a local ISIS governor or judge. The bearded official steps back and at his command, the four prisoners are beheaded on the tarmac road. Alleged spies: The four men were accused of being spies for the Baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an Islamic court . Kneeling in matching black jumpsuits, the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs . Unusually for a public ISIS execution, no residents seem to have been allowed to witness the killings, despite it being carried out in a public place. The final two photos - too graphic to publish - show the severed heads of the victims. Just last week, footage was released of nine men being executed by ISIS for allegedly being spies. Each man was forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament. All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads. Senseless: Last week, ISIS released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists . Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress . They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground. The masked ISIS commander who introduces the senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'. The graphic footage, filmed in an unknown location in the Middle East, ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood. It was the second video of an ISIS execution to surface last week following the brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. The terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq. Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS .
 year Colts | old franchise history | greatest => Reggie Wayne's 14-year career with the Indianapolis Colts is over. The 36-year-old six time Pro Bowler is second in franchise history in receptions (1,070), receiving yards (14,345), touchdown catches (80) and 100-yard games (43). He was a cornerstone of the Colts' Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears, hauling in a 53-yard touchdown pass to open their scoring in Miami. Wayne did not miss a game from 2003-2012, but his career stalled after an ACL injury in 2013 and an elbow injury the following year. Reggie Wayne joined the Colts in 2001 as a first round draft pick and won the Super Bowl in 2007 . Wayne remains one of the Colts' most popular players with fans celebrating their hero in 2011 . 'Reggie is one of the greatest men to ever wear the horseshoe, and we have been blessed to watch him play for the past 14 years,' Colts owner Jim Irsay said in a statement. 'When he first took the field with us in 2001, we knew this day would eventually arrive. That reality is one of the things that makes pro football such a tough business.' He remains the league's active leader in receptions and receiving yards, and third in touchdowns.

She just loved her family and would cook a Sunday lunch for 17 most weekends.' Mr Webber said he feels sorry for the families of everyone killed in the crash, which happened on a notorious winding stretch of the A470 through the Brecon Beacons National Park. He said: 'It's tragic that one moment in a night can take away your life just like that.

Scroll down for video . It is the second tragedy to hit her family after two of her siblings died in the 1966 Aberfan colliery disaster. Mrs Challis witnessed the horrific incident as a 16-year-old and was just yards away when her eight-year-old brother and seven-year-old sister were tragically killed along with 116 other school children and 28 adults. A bunch of flowers were left on the side of the A470 where the crash took place on Friday night . Mrs Challis was standing at the bus stop on October 21, 1966 waiting for her lift to school when she saw the enormous colliery slag heap which loomed above her siblings' school collapse and destroy the classrooms. More than 40,000 cubic metres of discarded rock, shale and mud covered the village in minutes, and the classrooms at Pantglas Junior School were swallowed by the mud slide - crushing and suffocating the school children and teachers inside. Mrs Challis's neighbour said: 'She had talked about the disaster and it still moved her to tears. 'She remembered the day vividly as does everyone caught up in the tragedy. It is so sad the way her life ended.' Rhodri Miller (pictured left) had only passed his test three days before the fatal crash and was killed along with girlfriend Alesha O'Connor (centre) and friend Corey Price (right). All were aged 17 . Friday's tragedy happened when A-level pupil Rhodri celebrated passing his driving test three days previously by going for a cruise with friends in his green VW Golf. He was in a six-car convoy with other teenages on a dangerous mountain road when he lost control on a bend. The victims' families paid tribute to them on Monday as friends lay flowers outside Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, the school where Rhodri and Corey were pupils. The families of the three teenagers said they were struggling to come to terms with their loss. Rhodri's parents described their son, a season ticket holder at Cardiff City FC, as 'a bright, talented' A-level student 'who had so much to live for'. Alesha's mother and father, Sharon and Paul, said: 'She was the perfect daughter and friend and has left a massive void in our family. 'Alesha was beautiful, intelligent and artistic and had her whole life ahead of her. We as a family would like to pass on our sympathy to the other families who have lost loved ones.' Corey's famiy added: 'The family of Corey Price are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of their wonderful gentle and caring son, brother, uncle and grandson. 'No words can explain how we are feeling but we are truly grateful of the support of our family and friends at this tragic time.' Seven teenage boys, aged 17 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and bailed by police. Superintendent Chris Curtis, of Dyfed Powys Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families at this difficult time. 'We are working with South Wales Police in order to provide support to the families affected and also the communities they live within. We will work with partners to ensure that the incident is fully investigated.'

 know | Nominations 2015 | people kids minimum wage broken car subzero => Minneapolis (CNN)Unexpected car repairs can blow anyone's budget. But when you're struggling to make ends meet, the impact can extend well beyond your bank account. As a social worker in Minneapolis, Cathy Heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients' health, their jobs, even their homes. For years, she wished someone would do something about the problem. Then one day Heying realized, "Oh dang, I think that somebody might be me." In 2008, she quit her full-time job and enrolled in automotive school. Five years later, armed with a degree in auto technology, Heying founded The Lift. Her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low-income individuals. The approach is simple: Heying sells parts at cost, with no markup, and charges $15 an hour for labor; the going rate in Minneapolis is around $100 an hour. The result? Big savings for her customers. And for those who can't pay in full, she will work out payment plans. To date, Heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low-income individuals, saving them more than $170,000 and keeping them on the road to success. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . I talked with Heying about her career change and what she's learned from her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. Kathleen Toner: One day you're a social worker, the next you're in automotive school. What was that like? Cathy Heying: Imagine a scene of a 38-year-old woman and 18-year-old boys. I want to talk about feelings and people, and they want to talk about cars. That sums it up. It was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift. I had to use my brain very differently. I did not grow up working on cars. I did not have a father that wrenched on cars. It was not part of my life growing up. I taught myself a few things (like) changing oil. But for the most part, I had no skills around car maintenance. I cried all the way to school the first day 'cause I was like, "What have I done?" So it was terrifying and overwhelming. And at least three solid times in that first quarter, I was like, "I'm quitting. I cannot do this." See more CNN Heroes . I give credit, at least in that first quarter, to one of my instructors who's now on the board of The Lift, who kept saying, "I know that you have a good vision here, and I'm going to help you get through this." And when I really thought about it, going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage, who are living with a broken-down car in subzero weather. Basically, I needed to buck up. Toner: What's it like being a mechanic? Heying: It's physically hard. You find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions, digging under things. You're lifting tires. You're wrenching on things. But it is mentally challenging, and it can be really frustrating. Because you have all the pieces and for some reason, something is not working, and it's like, "What is it?" And to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together, it is, I think, way more difficult than I think the average person thinks it is. I think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor. People come in, they give you a list of symptoms. You try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis. And sometimes we get it wrong, but most of the time we get it right. But it is an art and a science mixed into one. It's a very satisfying job, when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running. At the end of the day, you can feel really good because you can look back and be like, "This is what I did today." Toner: You're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff. How so? Heying: Different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives. Some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system. Two of the three techs that we have I met when they were both experiencing homelessness. And they are all trained, formal, certified technicians. And so that is another piece of the work that we do at The Lift. We take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on. Toner: You save your clients a lot of money. How do they react? Heying: For the most part, people are ecstatic when they get the bill. And that just makes such a huge difference in people's lives. We had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car. And he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he didn't have heat in his car. And so it's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school, even though that's a really important piece of it. It's really about protecting people's lives. For many people, having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together. And it really allows them to remain independent, to remain self-sufficient, to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity. Want to get involved?

Sagnol played for Bayern from 2000 to 2009 but Zidane, a triple World Player of the Year and 1998 World Cup winner, is the highest-profile of the visitors. The seven met chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Monday and monitored training under Spaniard Pep Guardiola on Tuesday and Wednesday, Bayern said. In an interview for Bayern's official You Tube channel, Zidane said: 'It's an incredibly organised club with people like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Matthias Sammer, who used to play football and really live and breathe the game . Then you combine that with someone like Pep Guardiola and the players that are full of desire and have a very precise footballing philosophy.' 'Bayern are a big club, one of the top five in the world, but there's also a family atmosphere. I'm mightily impressed.' The Bavarians are enjoying one of the most successful spells in their 115-year history, having won the Champions League once and reached the final twice more in the past five seasons.

 Police car Thomas Allen Jr. 34 fear life | St. drive | Crimes Persons Unit => A Missouri man is dead after a fatal shooting involving a police officer on Saturday. This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m. Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop . While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off. The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck. The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home. Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting . The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident. The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA. While two police detain his female friend, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' Five gun shots are then fired and the man lies lifeless, face down.
 Washington worst natural disaster County history | honor | victims survivors hard losses | Families affected => A year after a mudslide killed 43 people in Washington state, community members gathered on Sunday for a moment of silence and prayer for those lost in worst natural disaster in Snohomish County history. Families, search-and-rescue team members, comfort dogs and other community members gathered on Washington Highway 530 at a ceremony for victims of a mudslide that struck one year ago in Oso, Washington. Names of the deceased were read off one by one as a bell toll marked each one who was killed on March 22, 2014 about 55 miles northeast of Seattle. Scroll down for video . Families, search and rescue team members, comfort dogs, and other community members gather on Washington Highway 530 at a ceremony for victims of a mudslide that struck one year ago in Oso, Washington . A man grieves while reading messages on a highway barrier at the ceremony to honor the 43 killed in last year's mudslide . Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the devastating mudslide killed 43 and destroyed Washington Highway 530 . Even as the land recovers, however, many of those affected by the mudslide say their nerves continue to be jangled by unresolved lawsuits, pending legislation, difficulties accessing relief funds and a parade of disaster site gawkers and profiteers. Though grass is finally sprouting, Don Young continues to clear his fields of debris, such as home siding and insulation, that is a bitter reminder of the tragedy. 'We should get growth this spring so we don't have to see this scar we've been looking at,' Young, 55, said as he recalled watching the approaching torrent. 'You don't want to keep re-living the damn thing, you know?' Amid an anniversary weekend of prayers, commemorations and a solemn moment of silence, families of victims and survivors say it is hard to reconcile themselves to their losses. 'There is healing that still needs to happen,' Oso Fire Chief Willy Harper said. 'There are a lot of emotions right now, sometimes they are right there on your face, and sometimes they are just below the surface.' The mudslide destroyed much of the area, pictured here, just ten days after on April 2, 2014. Though the land is recovering, residents of the area are still facing challenges . A flag is still present in the area and grass is beginning to grow. But those affected by the mudslide say their nerves continue to be jangled by unresolved lawsuits, pending legislation, difficulties accessing relief funds and a parade of disaster site gawkers and profiteers . The Washington state legislature is considering a transport package that includes funds of $36million over 12 years for laser mapping of landslide-prone areas. Bills would require the state to build a public database of laser-mapped areas and hazards, and tweak state law to let firefighters respond to all kinds of catastrophes, including landslides. A December 2014 report found the Washington State Patrol was unable to send in firefighters following the slide after a state lawyer said dispatching them would violate state law. At the epicenter of the disaster, a street sign marking the road that led to a subdivision where a cluster of homes was obliterated now offers a lookout point for motorists to take photos of the hillside gash. Forty-three small cedar trees, memorials to the dead, many decorated with multi-colored ribbons, heart-shaped wreaths and name tags, have been planted on the side of the re-built highway. Debris in the area is only partially cleaned up, as residents in the area continue to find home siding and insulation in their fields, bitter reminders of the tragedy . Representatives of the Washington State Patrol, Bellevue Fire Department, and other agencies march during a ceremony for victims of a mudslide . Members of the King County Firefighters Pipes and Drums prepare to perform at a ceremony that marks one year since the mudslide that killed 43 people . Several families still live in houses perched around the mile-wide debris area. Some complain visitors have let their dogs defecate on their property. Others felt it was insensitive when a company briefly put up a 'for sale' sign on the property of a bankrupt owner. Others were angered over river raft tours a company offered site visitors for $90. Those have now been suspended. Victims' families have complained in wrongful death suits that the state, county and hill landowner were aware of the disaster risk but made no efforts to divert the river or relocate homes. They also say logging added to the hill's instability. The landowner, Grandy Lake Forest Associates, has denied wrongdoing, and sought to dismiss the case, still in preliminary stages. Forty-three small cedar trees, memorials to the dead, many decorated with multi-colored ribbons, heart-shaped wreaths and name tags, have been planted on the side of the re-built highway . People left flowers, photos and cards in trees alongside other decorations to honor those who were victims of the mudslide . Major relief group American Red Cross, and charities United Way of Snohomish County, and Cascade Valley Hospital Foundation have handed out, or committed to disburse, roughly $8million from donations of more than $9.4million for aid such as housing stipends, grief counseling, food and clothing. Some families say they have faced delays when seeking help from relief agencies. For example, the parents of Summer Raffo, who was swept away while driving, had their electricity shut off when a six-month needs-based financial plan arranged with relief funds by a county case worker was changed by a new case manager. Representatives for Snohomish County and the Salvation Army did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'The frustration is not just with my family, it's every family,' said Summer's brother, Dayn Brunner, 43. 'The amount of money they have raised, versus what has gone directly to the families, is two different stories.' The highway, pictured above as a truck drives along, had to be rebuilt in the aftermath of the mudslide. it was closed until June 2014 . An American flag stands among the partially-cleaned-up debris field
 jury Marvin Gaye children 7.4million singers Robin father music Blurred Lines song 2013 | Nona wept verdict | staggering 16million T.I. | free free said statement courtroom following verdict | told jurors write Blurred Lines testified crafted hour | Gaye Nona Frankie Marvin Gaye III sued => A jury awarded Marvin Gaye's children $7.4million on Tuesday after determining singers Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams copied their father's music to create Blurred Lines, the biggest hit song of 2013. Marvin Gaye's daughter Nona Gaye wept as the verdict was being read and was hugged by her attorney, Richard Busch. The verdict could tarnish the legacy of Williams, a reliable hit-maker who has won Grammy Awards and appears on NBC's music competition show The Voice. It was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $16million for Pharrell, Thicke, rapper T.I. and the record company, though T.I. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges. The jury decided that the family should receive $4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song, with Thicke forced to pay $1.7million from his own pocket and Pharrell $1.6million. Scroll down for videos . Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) are seen leaving court last week during the trial . 'I feel free, free from...Pharrell Williams’ & Robin Thicke’s chains,' said Nona Gaye in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict . An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favor of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. All three later released a statement, saying; 'While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward. 'Blurred Lines’ was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and T.I. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else. We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.' 'Right now, I feel free,' an emotional Nona said after the verdict. 'Free from ... Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.' This was no doubt in response to the fact that Pharrell and Thicke had filed a lawsuit against Gaye's estate back in August 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement. 'Plaintiffs, who have the utmost respect for and admiration of Marvin Gaye, Funkadelic and their musical legacies, reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists. Defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs' massively successful composition, 'Blurred Lines,' copies 'their' compositions,' read the suit. This suit however was thrown out in October of that year, when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar. 'We did not start this fight… Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke started this lawsuit,” Busch said outside of the courthouse. 'We fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back.' Gaye, best known for such classics as Sexual Healing, I Heard It Through the Grapevine and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44-years-old . Nona Gaye (second from left), daughter of late singer Marvin Gaye, and her lawyer Richard Busch (front right) speak to the media following the verdict . The Gayes' lawyer branded Pharrell and Thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of Gaye's late-1970s music and copied the R&B legend's hit Got to Give It Up outright. He also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing Gaye's song during the proceedings, allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music. For this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs, making the case against Thicke and Pharrell that much more difficult for the Gaye family. Busch however pointed out during his argument that Thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and Pharrell were trying to write something like Gaye's Got to Give It Up. Thicke told jurors he didn't write Blurred Lines, which Pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid-2012, as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol. 'The biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else, and I was jealous and wanted credit,' said Thicke. He also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case . Pharrell told jurors that Gaye's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth, but the seven-time Grammy winner said he didn't use any of it to create Blurred Lines and that the songs were alike in genre only. The pair's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict, saying; 'They're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently.' Busch, far left, walks with the late singer, Marvin Gaye's family members, from left, daughter, Nona, ex-wife, Jan, and son, Frankie . According to the Los Angeles Times, he song brought in $5.6 million for Thicke, $5.2 million for Pharrell and another $5 million to $6 million for the record company, as well as an additional $8 million in publishing revenue . Gaye's children - Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read. The family had initially asked for $40million in damages, but later lowered that number to $25million. This was based on the amount of money they believed Gaye would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song. Gaye's ex-wife Janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new
 reportedly shot ISIS | bleed death | allegedly paying => An innocent man with severe mental disabilities was reportedly shot and left to die in the streets by ISIS police in Syria. Whilst passing through a checkpoint, an ISIS police officer began to interrogate the mentally disabled man. His rough treatment and apparent disregard for the man's health condition led to the IS militant being slapped on the face by the innocent man. Brutal regime: ISIS have become well known for their extreme use of violence in governing parts of Syria and Iraq. The brutal ISIS police officer pulled out his gun and shot the disabled man several times from close range. Nearby residents were prevented from coming to the dying man's aid, forced to watch as he was left to bleed to death on his own. The man's death was first reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London based human rights group focused on the conflict in Syria. The London based human rights group have reported that the atrocity happened in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, renamed by ISIS as Al Kheir. Local sources confirmed that a young man, suffering from a debilitating mental illness had been murdered by ISIS. According to activists, the young man was targeted at a checkpoint inside the city of al-Mayadin. The Islamist group published photos showing a man being publicly whipped for drinking wine in Deir ezzor last week. ISIS's police force have a terrifying reputation for indiscriminate brutality, carrying out public executions, amputations and floggings in accordance with ISIS's radical interpretation of Shariah law. Local Kurdish photojournalist Jack Shahine reported that a 55 year old woman was allegedly burnt to death for not paying her taxes. The woman was allegedly named as Sanaa al-Shummari but her death has not been independently verified.
 Chemical Depot begin largest stockpile chemical weapons | U.S. => (CNN)The Pueblo Chemical Depot will begin destroying the United States' largest remaining stockpile of chemical weapons Tuesday in southern Colorado. There are 2,611 tons of World War II-era mustard agent at the Pueblo depot. Here are nine things to know about these chemical weapons and how we got here: . 1. First use: April 22 marks the 100th anniversary of the first use of chemical weapons in modern warfare at Ypres in Belgium. 2. Huge production: From World War I to 1968, the United States produced nearly 40,000 tons of chemical weapons. These weapons were either nerve agents or blister agents. 3. Scary stuff: Mustard agent is a blister agent, which can cause skin redness and itching, eye irritation, scarring, and an increased risk for lung and respiratory cancer. 4. Into the sea: From 1967 to 1970, the U.S. Army disposed of thousands of chemical warfare agents and ammunition into the sea as part of Operation Cut Holes and Sink 'Em (CHASE). 5. No more: Congress passed a law in 1972 known as the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act prohibiting this kind of dumping. 6. Date of destruction: In 1997, the United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty and agreed to destroy all of its chemical weapons by April 29, 2012. 7. Work not done: 90% of the U.S. stockpile -- 30,500 tons -- was destroyed by the treaty date in 2012 at depots in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Oregon, Utah and Johnson Atoll in the Pacific. The remaining 10% -- close to 3,100 tons -- is at two sites in Colorado and Kentucky. 9. Don't burn it: Residents in Colorado and Kentucky protested the use of incineration to get rid of the chemical weapons stockpile. The process of neutralization was adopted. 8. Pueblo's stockpile: The Pueblo Chemical Depot has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent. 9. The last one: The Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, Kentucky, will have the remaining chemical agent stockpile, which is a fifth of the size of the one at Pueblo Chemical Depot. But the Kentucky site has a larger variety of chemical weapons, including nerve agent.
 group | new regional task force designed target extremists Nigeria Chad | Nigerian military destroyed headquarters facto Gwoza | Cameroon Niger Benin contribute => Britain is to give £5million to help efforts to defeat terror group Boko Haram, it emerged today. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the money would support a new regional task force designed to target the Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin area. It came as the Nigerian military said it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the money would support a new regional task force designed to target the Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin area . Mr Hammond said 'important gains' were being made in taking on Boko Haram, as talks were being held in at the UN in New York. Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin will contribute to the task force, which has been authorised by the African Union. Talks are taking place in New York to endorse the unit via a United Nations' security resolution. Mr Hammond said: 'The UK fully supports the efforts of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin to tackle the scourge of Boko Haram. 'I hope that the international community can send an important message of support through the swift adoption of a security council resolution in New York to welcome the force. 'Important gains are already being made on the ground in tackling Boko Haram by the regional partners who will contribute to the task force. 'It will continue to play an important role in fighting this terrorist insurgency. I commend the commitment and bravery of the troops involved. 'The UK continues to stand strong with Nigeria and its neighbours in tackling this heinous group.' Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children from primary schools to use them as 'human shields'. The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week. When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids. Liberators: The Nigerian military says its soldiers (pictured) have destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza . Brutal: Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau (pictured) declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August . Today the official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.' It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader. It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria. The Twitter messages made no mention of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps. Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace.
 U.S. armored vehicles allies actions | long ton Strykers usually rail => (CNN)Eastern Europe, here comes the cavalry. The U.S. Army says it will soon be sending armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in the Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. The move was first reported Thursday in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. U.S. Army Europe posted the Stripes story on its website on Friday. The convoy is "a highly visible demonstration of U.S, commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO's ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation," U.S. Army Europe spokesman Lt. Col. Craig Childs, said in a statement, according to the Stripes report. The troops and vehicles involved will be moving from training exercises conducted as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, the report said. They'll move through Latvia and the Czech Republic as they make their way to Vilseck, Germany, about a 40 miles drive from the Czech border. The troops involved are from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which are based at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, and they will be accompanied by the Army's 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, which will provide aerial reconnaissance, the Stripes report said. The move is unusual because long-distance movement of heavy military vehicles such as the 18-ton Strykers is usually done by rail. The trek is being called a "Dragoon Ride," after the unit's nickname, the Dragoons. Troops will camp out along the route. "For those participating in it, Dragoon Ride is a unique opportunity," Stripes quoted Childs as saying. "Soldiers and their leaders will have numerous opportunities to engage with local communities along the route, deepen their appreciation for the cultural diversity within the alliance and enhance the relationships that are essential to building and maintaining mutual admiration, respect and trust among allied militaries." The convoy will be the latest in a series of displays the U.S. and its NATO allies have taken under Operation Atlantic Resolve, during which the U.S. "is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine," according to the Defense Department's website. The displays have come as close to 300 yards from the Russian border as U.S. Army Strykers participated in an independence day celebration in Nava, Estonia, last month. Other recent actions include the Air Force's movement of 12 A-10 Thunderbolt "tankbuster" attack jets to an air base in Germany and this month the placing of hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll soon be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Tension with Russia extends to the air too. Adm. William Gortney, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that "this past year has marked a notable increase in Russian military assertiveness." Russian heavy bomber aircraft flew more patrols outside Russian airspace "than in any year since the Cold War," though he did not offer a specific number. There have also been increased Russian air patrols across the coastlines of Europe.
 Z industry biggest discuss | space days Kanye West blurting | suggested network | Punk curate => Jay Z hosted the music industry's biggest stars at a glittering business meeting to lament 'crass commercialization' and plot their own rival to Spotify, it is claimed. Madonna, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Daft Punk, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Jack White, Rihanna, an unnamed prominent country singer, and Jay Z's wife Beyoncé all gathered in February to share their thoughts, Showbiz 411 reported. And today the rapper, whose real name is Shawn Carter, confirmed his $54 million purchase of Swedish streaming network Aspiro, parent company of music platform WiMP. The program, which he plans to rename TidalHifi, will uniquely allow artists to profit from their material and directly upload quality tracks. Daft Punk's two members were key figures in deciding on a strategy during the meeting days before the Grammy Awards at The Fig House event space in a remote part of Pasadena, Los Angeles, a source told Showbiz 411. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glittering business: Jay Z hosted some of the music industry's biggest names, including his wife Beyoncé (pictured together in 2014) at a secret meeting last month to discuss the commercialization of the industry . Putting their heads together: Nicki Minaj and Madonna joined the group in a remote event space in Pasadena, Los Angeles, days before the Grammy Awards in February to share their ideas (both pictured last month) Kanye West, pictured at Paris Fashion Week, was full of ideas that he kept blurting out, Showbiz 411 reported . They apparently suggested artists should be involved in curating and editing that material on the network. Meanwhile Kanye West was 'out of control'. A source told the site: 'He blurts things out. Jay Z kept him by his side and joked that he was his "interpreter".' On Friday, a spokesman for Project Panther Bidco, a company controlled by the 45-year-old rapper, said all the conditions for completing the acquisition of Aspiro had now been fulfilled. Owners representing more than 90 percent of shares in the Swedish-listed firm accepted the $54 million offer on Wednesday, the spokesman said. Panther Bidco will now initiate the compulsory purchase of the remaining Aspiro shares, as well as delisting the company from Nasdaq Stockholm. Rihanna arrived late to the meeting but contributed thoughts alongside Coldplay's Chris Martin, reports say . Daft Punk are said to have made persuasive contributions, saying artists should curate the stream . Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (left) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (right) were among the selected few . Completing the line-up, as well as an unnamed country music singer, was singer Jack White . The deal will pit Jay-Z against Spotify, and also Dr Dre after his streaming service, Beats Music, was bought by Apple. In January, shares in Aspiro, which runs music streaming service WiMP, leaped 59 per cent in early trading to the bid level of 1.05 crowns per share. 'I think they will be a better owner to lift Aspiro and its advanced music streaming service to a new level,' said Trond Berger, the financial director of Norwegian media group Shibsted, currently Aspiro's majority owner. At the end of the third quarter of 2014, Wimp said it had 512,000 paying users in Germany, Poland and the Nordic countries. That is a far cry from its Nordic rival Spotify, a pioneer in the streaming music business. The unlisted company boasted 15 million paying subscribers in mid-January and is available in 58 countries. Norwegian business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported in January that Jay Z's company was particularly interested in Wimp's high-fidelity Tidal streaming service which is being launched on the US market. 'The Wimp/Tidal service has the potential for greatness, given that it has high-end audio capabilities,' music specialist Simon Dyson at corporate analytics firm Ovum told AFP in an email, adding that the $56-million price tag was 'not excessive'. It would need substantial investments to challenge Spotify or US tech giant Apple's widely expected entry into the market later this year after acquiring Beats Music from another rap star, Dr Dre, in 2014. Jay-Z is one of the world's . best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than . 100 million records. Forbes estimated last year that his net . worth was $520 million. Jay-Z has bought the Swedish music streaming company for $54 million to add to his business empire .

 June 2014 shortly chip Super Clarksville family suing | grocery liable Allergen Consumer Protection Act | employee cookie tree => The family of an 11-year-old boy are suing the Publix grocery chain, saying the child was allergic to nuts and died from a severe reaction after eating a cookie despite a worker's assurance it was safe. The lawsuit says Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville. The boy, who was visiting family in Tennessee, was allergic to tree nuts. Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville and now his family are suing the food chain . The lawsuit, which was filed on March 20, says the store bakery did not post warnings about ingredients or possible cross-contamination, and the mother bought the cookie only after a worker assured her it was safe. Derek's family filed the lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Nashville and are seeking unspecified amount of damages. They claim the grocery store should be declared liable under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 'to raise awareness of potential fatal food allergies in American children.' The family also claims Publix was negligent for not labeling its baked goods and identifying any allergens, for not posting signs warning of potential allergens or cross-contamination and for not properly training employees to respond to questions about food allergens. A Publix spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation but said in an email that the company posts allergen information at its bakeries. 'We were very sorry about the loss if this young man. Our prayers go out for him and his family,' a Publix Super Markets spokesperson told USA Today. The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix Super Market in Clarksville, above . The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix store. Landon's mom bought an unlabeled 'Chocolate Chew' cookie that he wanted. The mother specifically asked a Publix employee at the bakery counter whether the cookie contained any tree nuts. 'The Publix associate affirmatively said the Chocolate Chew contained no tree nut ingredients,' the lawsuit states. Landon ate the cookie back at his aunt's house and then went into anaphylactic shock. He died despite being immediately being given medication by his mother and efforts by emergency medical personnel and doctors at a local hospital.
 British Prime Minister David Cameron formally Parliament way campaigning ahead 7 general | official | elections => London (CNN)British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asked Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve his country's Parliament on Monday, opening the way for campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election. The procedural step means there are officially no members of Parliament until it reconvenes on May 18 for the swearing-in of members and the official state opening of Parliament on May 27. Addressing media outside the official prime ministerial residence at 10 Downing St., Cameron said that Britain had been "on the brink" when he came into office. "Of course, we haven't fixed everything, but Britain is back on her feet again." Cameron said the nation faced "a stark choice" in 38 days. "The next Prime Minister walking through that door will be me or (Labour Party leader) Ed Miliband," he said. "You can choose an economy that grows, that creates jobs, that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving NHS (National Health Service) ... and a government that will cut taxes for 30 million hard-working people ... or you can choose the economic chaos of Ed Miliband's Britain," Cameron said. "After five years of effort and sacrifice, Britain is on the right track. This election is about moving forward -- and as Prime Minister here at No. 10 that's what I will deliver." Miliband launched Labour's Business Manifesto on Monday, saying that a second Conservative term would threaten Britain's EU membership and pose "a clear and present danger" to British firms and prosperity. "There are two futures on offer at this election," Miliband said. "To carry on with a Conservative plan based on the idea that as long as the richest and most powerful succeed, everyone else will be OK. Or a Labour plan, a better plan, that says it is only when working people succeed that Britain succeeds." Miliband also referenced Cameron's March 23 announcement that the Conservative leader had ruled out standing for a third term -- before the election that will decide whether he even gets a second term in the top job -- saying the Conservative candidates would be "vying against each other for who can be the most extreme on Europe." Cameron and his Conservative Party won the last election in 2010, but not by enough to go into government alone. Without a majority in Parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs, or lawmakers, from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber that passes laws and legislation. For five years, Cameron has been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, has mostly backed Cameron in parliamentary debates against Labour's Miliband. "For the first time ever, the Liberal Democrats go into this campaign with a record of action in government to be extremely proud of," Clegg said Monday. "We have kept the government in the center ground and shown that we are the only party that can build a stronger economy and a fairer society." The right-wing UK Independence Party, or UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. Last year, in a backlash against the EU, UKIP caused a political earthquake and won elections to the European Parliament in Britain, and some commentators have likened its impact on UK politics to that of the tea party in the United States. It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the May 7 UK general election. Some of its supporters appeared to be casting protest votes last year and could return to the established Conservative and Labour parties when more is at stake. On Monday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: "UKIP is the party of real change for real people. If you #VoteUKIP on May 7th, you'll get MPs willing to hold the government to account." Meanwhile, in Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that it could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond quit after the referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon now heads the party. "The general election on May 7 is a fantastic opportunity for Scotland to make Westminster sit up and take notice," Sturgeon said Monday. "By holding the balance of power in a hung Parliament, SNP MPs can work with others to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street -- and ensure that Scotland's priorities become priorities at Westminster," she said. Eligible Britons must be registered by April 20 to vote.

 Toby bidding | Belgium international Manchester | performances | form unnoticed | Tottenham Mauricio | sign permanently => Southampton fear they will miss out on a permanent move for on loan defender Toby Alderweireld with parent club Atletico Madrid intent on sparking a bidding war for the player. The Belgium international has impressed for the Saints this season prior to sustaining a hamstring injury at Manchester United in January. His performances have been central to Southampton's attempt to finish in the Premier League's top four, and manager Ronald Koeman wants to make the loan move permanent ahead of the next campaign. However, Alderweireld's form has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is understood to be an admirer of the 26-year-old, while Manchester City remain in the hunt for defensive reinforcements with Manuel Pellegrini yet to find the perfect partner for captain Vincent Kompany. Southampton will face a challenge if they want to sign on loan defender Toby Alderweireld (left) permanently . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (centre) is understood to be an admirer of the defender . Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is keen to add defensive reinforcements to his squad . Pellegrini feels that Alderweireld could act as the perfect partner to captain Vincent Kompany . Both Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala have been given opportunities but have so far not done enough to convince anybody at the Etihad Stadium that they can help take City to the next level, particularly in Europe. Southampton have a £6.8million option on Alderweireld as part of their loan deal but it's thought Atletico may well use a clause in the deal that stipulates they can essentially pay £1.5m to cancel that and then sell the player to the highest bidder. Alderweireld gets across to tackle Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) during the Premier League game . Alderweireld suffered a hamstring injury during Southampton's 1-0 victory over Manchester United . That would leave Koeman sweating on his attempts to take the former Ajax defender on a full-time basis. Southampton work to a tight budget and know they'd be facing an uphill struggle in striking a deal with Atletico this summer if bigger clubs enter the race. Alderweireld signed for Atletico from Ajax for a fee of £6.2 million in 2013, and the Spanish club are keen to recoup as much of that fee as possible. Alderweireld has 43 caps for Belgium since making his international debut back in 2009 . The 26-year-old slides in with a challenge on Newcastle United's striker Emanuel Riviere (left)
 airlines considering policies tragedy 150 people | Qantas monitoring | regulators needed => One of Australia's biggest airlines has revealed that they are still considering whether to strengthen their cockpit policies following the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 people. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they are 'monitoring' the information coming out of the French investigation following the chilling revelation that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 locked the pilot out before hurtling the plane to the ground. The airline say they are in 'discussions with regulators' over cockpit changes and are still unsure if a review is needed to safeguard passengers. Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies . 'We have a comprehensive safety management system that guards against risks to our operations. This includes multi-layered systems to protect the flight deck on our aircraft,' a spokesperson for Qantas said. The airline also said that their pilots' health and well-being are very important to them, claiming they have a rigid recruitment process which includes psychometric testing. 'Periodic aeromedical tests are carried by doctors out once a year for pilots under 40 years old and every six months for pilots over 40,' they said. 'All pilots must complete regular Crew Resource Management training, which among other things includes training in stress management, teamwork, communication and behavioural awareness. 'Like all employees, pilots have access to confidential counselling services and safety reporting channels.' In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened . A more thorough review had been ordered to consider the findings of the investigation of the Germanwings crash, in which 150 people were killed when the A320 slammed into the French Alps. In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. They said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew. However they said that these details remain confidential for security purposes . 'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.' It dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane. The final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said it was 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's plan to 'destroy the plane'. The Qantas review comes as airlines and aviation regulators around the world have begun taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit. Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . The Civil Aviation Authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across airlines. In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit. Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'. Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today - postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'. Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'. German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf. Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene
 team return behaviour outbound | university | Dover Calais | condoned Students Union message teams => A Cardiff University rugby team was banned from a P&O ferry for 'appalling' behaviour during which a trainee medic allegedly urinated on a family dining table. A rugby team from the university School of Medicine was on a rugby tour to Amsterdam when the incident was alleged to have taken place on a ferry from Dover. P&O confirmed the team were barred from the return journey after their behaviour on the outbound trip. P&O Ferries have confirmed the rugby team from Cardiff University were not allowed to return on one of their ships after their 'appalling behaviour' (File Photo) One anonymous student told university newspaper Gair Rhydd: 'I was told that one rugby player got so drunk they urinated in someone's food.' Company spokesman Brian Rees said: 'It relates to a group who travelled with us from Dover to Calais in mid February. 'Unfortunately behaviour was such that we had to explain that we would not offer them the return journey so they made other arrangements to get back. 'The behaviour was so appalling we didn't have a moment's hesitation in banning them from coming back with us.' A Cardiff University spokesperson said the university had been made aware of an incident involving Cardiff Medics Rugby Team. However, no formal complaints have been made to the university. Cardiff University have confirmed they are investigating the incident after allegations of bad behaviour . The spokesperson added: 'The alleged behaviour is certainly not the behaviour we expect of our students. As far as we have been able to establish we have not received a formal complaint. 'However, on receiving this information, we are investigating the exact circumstances and will need to consider what action will need to be taken.' Elliot Howells, Cardiff Students' Union President, said: 'We are aware of an incident involving the Medics Rugby Team and are investigating this concurrently with Cardiff University. 'Should any individuals be found to be responsible, appropriate action will be taken. This type of behaviour is not condoned by the Students' Union and we convey this message strongly to sports teams during their yearly induction sessions.' Cardiff Medics has both a first and second XV. It is not clear which team was involved in the incident.
 latest action estimated | Run Night soft second place => (CNN)"Cinderella," the latest live-action retelling of a classic, sparkled like a glass slipper in its opening weekend, with an estimated debut of $70.1 million. That's well above expectations of $50 to 60 million, and it tops last year's $69.4 million opening for "Maleficent," another take on the classic fairy tale, which featured Angelina Jolie and a darker tone. This version, however is sweetness and light, thanks to veteran director Kenneth Branagh. Small-screen stars Lily James ("Downton Abbey") and Richard Madden ("Game of Thrones") play Ella and her Prince, who overcome personal grief and uncertainty with courage and goodness. Oscar winner Cate Blanchett provides venom as the wicked stepmother. Reviews for "Cinderella" have been strong, with a current Rotten Tomatoes rating of 83%. Disney timed the release well: It's been more than a month since a family film hit theaters (if you can call the "SpongeBob" sequel a "family" film), and some American school districts just began spring break. Liam Neeson's latest thriller, "Run All Night," opened in a very soft second place. Neeson has been a solid draw since he reinvented himself as an action star six years ago with "Taken," but "Run All Night" debuted even more weakly than last year's dismal "A Walk Among the Tombstones." This time out, he plays a former hit man whose family is targeted by his old boss, played by Ed Harris -- but it seems people would rather see Neeson attack and fight than run. In limited release, the critically acclaimed horror thriller "It Follows" made $163,000 in just four theaters, far and away the weekend's best per-theater average. Among returning films, Colin Firth and "Kingsman: The Secret Service" shone the brightest, topping the $100 million mark in total domestic grosses and actually rising a spot on the chart, while last weekend's winner, "Chappie," and runner-up, "Focus," duked it out for fourth place. Next weekend, Shailene Woodley returns in the young adult action sequel "The Divergent Series: Insurgent," while Sean Penn tries the action genre with Idris Elba and Javier Bardem in "The Gunman."
 spending Russia | 2 GDP => Crippling cuts to defence spending have left Britain unable to defend itself or stand up to Russia, according to the former head of the Army. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin. He joins a growing chorus of criticism of the refusal by any of the main parties to protect defence spending from cuts after the election, despite a pledge to increase foreign aid budgets being enshrined in law. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin . A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. Sir Peter, who retired as head of the army last summer, warned the West has been 'caught napping' amid increasing threats from the Russian Federation and Islamic State. He criticised the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) and said funding reductions were based on the assumption that there would be a 'reasonably benign security environment for this decade' following the drawdown of combat troops from Afghanistan. 'It was acknowledged that we would have less capability in an unexpected crisis than we would wish, and our political choices would be constrained,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We can now see those consequences playing out in our reticence to counter Russian expansionism, and her interference in our airspace and offshore waters.' Sir Peter called on the Government to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He wrote: 'In an era of moral and physical disarmament the West has been caught napping.' It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts. Up to 30,000 service personnel could go - with the Army likely to bear the heaviest cuts - leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade, it predicted. Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence . Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target. The leadership is braced for significant criticism over its position when a backbench business motion comes before the Commons on Thursday. Nick Clegg has claimed Mr Cameron will fail to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence because he is ideologically wedded to shrinking the state. Labour has also refused to commit to the figure, with the party's Treasury spokesman, Chris Leslie, telling the BBC: 'I know it will be difficult to keep that level of 2 per cent of GDP, but I can tell you it is absolutely impossible under the Conservative trajectory.'
 hate groups year | 72 chapters 163 | wave => (CNN)America may be growing less hateful. That's according to an annual Southern Poverty Law Center report that says the number of hate groups in the United States remains on the decline for the second year in a row. In the "Intelligence Report" released Tuesday, the SPLC says the number of hate groups operating in the U.S. declined 17% between 2013 and 2014. They are now at their lowest levels since 2005, the watchdog organization said. "Patriot groups, which are animated by a series of conspiracy theories about the alleged evils of the federal government, fell even faster, to 874 groups from a 2012 peak of 1,360 groups. In just the last year, the number of Patriot groups declined by 20%, from 1,096 groups to 874," the report said. "But those numbers may be somewhat deceiving. More than half of the decline in hate groups was of Ku Klux Klan chapters, and many of those have apparently gone underground, ending public communications, rather than disbanding." The decline may be due to a number of factors, including the rebounding economy, law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups, the SPLC said. The "high social" cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline, the group said. "The atmosphere has changed," Mark Potok, editor-in-chief of the "Intelligence Report," told reporters on a conference call. "Overall, the groups are less important." People publishing messages of hate directly to the Internet is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups. California and Florida have the largest number of hate groups, with more than 50 each. Alaska and Hawaii are the only states with no hate groups, according to the SPLC. The report tracks the number of chapters or groups, not individual members, so while the number of groups is on the decline, it's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership. The Ku Klux Klan experienced the largest decline of all hate groups, according to the report, losing more than 50% of its chapters. One of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the United States, the KKK took its foothold after the Civil War, terrorizing the African-American population with intimidation and violent actions, including lynching. The Klan's growth slowed after the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the American South, according to the SPLC. The KKK's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The group was again responsible for large-scale terror against the South's African-American population. In 1990, the SPLC started to keep track of the number of KKK chapters, which reached a high of 221 in 2010, in response to President Barack Obama's election, according to the report. Since then, the numbers have been on the decline. The SPLC now reports 72 chapters, down from 163 a year ago. Under Obama, 4 in 10 say race relations worsened . The reason for the decline of the Ku Klux Klan is not totally clear, though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground. "It appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older, but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were," the report said. The center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are Klan members in the United States. Opinion: America facing anti-Muslim bigotry . The SPLC report also notes that more people may be operating as so-called lone wolves. The overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since. However, the number of registered users to Stormfront -- a website claiming to be "the voice of the new, embattled White minority!" -- has doubled since 2008. It now has nearly 300,000 users. Lone wolves are a concern, the report said, because 90% of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs. Lone wolf planned attack on U.S. Capitol, FBI says . The report points to neo-Nazi Frazier Glenn Miller, who allegedly killed three people in Kansas who he thought were Jewish, and an incident in Las Vegas, where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves, as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone. The SPLC refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the Internet, to become more anonymous. Looking towards next year, SPLC is "expecting a real wave of Islamophobia" because of the proliferation of ISIS and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group, Potok told reporters.
 Lord Russian espionage soared | Russia trawlers communications senior | fishing boats seen international waters North Sea | Putin acts provocation => Retired commander: Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level . Russia has deployed a fleet of spy trawlers off the British coast to intercept military communications, one of Britain’s most senior retired commanders said yesterday. Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level as president Vladimir Putin ordered more acts of ‘provocation’. Equipped with hi-tech surveillance, the converted fishing boats have been seen in the international waters of the North Sea by Nato aircraft. Lord West, a former First Sea Lord, said the Cold War tactic was designed to gain intelligence on Britain’s nuclear missiles and warships. He said: ‘It was quite a tense business during the Cold War and now it is winding up again and it is very worrying. They seem to have... increased espionage, which raises tension.’ Lord West spoke out as Moscow mobilised the country’s entire Northern Fleet to full combat readiness. In a show of strength, Putin deployed 45,000 troops, more than 56 warships and submarines, and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the Barents Sea – dwarfing Nato military drills which will be held off Scotland next month. Lord West, a military grandee, said the five-day drills were a ‘knee jerk’ reaction to a similar Nato operation announced by Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday. Britain and 11 other Nato countries will contribute to the Joint Warrior exercise designed to send a signal to Moscow in the face of continued aggression – but with a force strength of less than a third. The operation – which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe – will feature just 12,000 military personnel. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how ‘powerful’ Nato was. Lord West said of Putin’s mobilisation: ‘It is clearly a knee jerk reaction to the fact we are about to do that exercise… and it raises escalation. Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a ‘worrying’ level as president Vladimir Putin (pictured) ordered more acts of ‘provocation’ In a show of strength, Putin deployed 45,000 troops, more than 56 warships and submarines, and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the Barents Sea . 'Their conventional forces were incapable of mobilising quickly a few years ago and that has changed. ‘It is all very worrying as Putin is very unpredictable and is not obeying the norms of international order. ‘Russia has nuclear weapons and they believe they can be used for war fighting and that is hugely dangerous and means we are just a step away from the destruction of the globe.’ The spook ships sent by Moscow can intercept ‘voice transmissions’ up to 200 miles, with RAF Lossiemouth and Coningsby understood to be two of their targets as Russian Bear bombers fly close to UK airspace. The ships, known within Nato as AGIs, or Auxiliary Intelligence Gathering ships, eavesdrop on UK air bases and alert Soviet aircrews by secure communications so they know when the Typhoon crews from the Air Reaction Alert force are taking off. A senior military source said: ‘It would appear from our intelligence that they are working in support of Soviet bombers which have been seen off the east coast and as far south as Cornwall and simply record our reaction to these events.’ The spook ships sent by Moscow can intercept ‘voice transmissions’ up to 200 miles, with RAF Lossiemouth (pictured) and Coningsby understood to be two of their targets . At least one vessel has been spotted off the west coast of Scotland where Nato will hold their major exercise next month. The Russians tried to monitor amphibious war games in the past and will sit in international waters monitoring communications traffic. In the past three weeks, Nato P3 Orion spy planes from the United States and Norway have reported six AGIs, adding to concerns that the Soviet activity is part of a planned maritime and air operation against the UK. The source said: ‘While they look like fishing vessels they are packed with ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) and make no secret of their presence, all they want is to sit and test our reaction times and collate communications. ‘The problem is that while we managed to deal with them in the 1980s by jamming their electronic ‘listening’ field, they had updated their systems with much greater capability and as long as they sit in international waters we can do nothing.’ Scrambled: A Typhoon jet seen taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire at 4.30pm, shortly before Russian planes were intercepted last month . Lord West added: ‘They are very capable trawlers. There are lots of things the Russians want to know and they do go to try and find it out. ‘There is much more provocation from Russia. Putin does like to watch what Nato are doing as he is worried about it and sees it as an offensive alliance.’ The Russian move is the latest in a series of military ‘cat and mouse’ incidents as tension with the West soars to the highest level since the Cold War stand off in the 1980s, when Soviet spy ships sat off the UK coastline. Britain’s decision to scrap the Nimrod maritime spy plane has left the RAF with little capability to monitor Soviet maritime movements and has instead relied on Nato allies to help. The source added: ‘The sighting of a periscope was very concerning and highlighted our lack of capability. ‘Next month we will have support from Nato aircraft that will mount anti-submarine patrols as we launch a major exercise off the west coast of Scotland. ‘It will test our amphibious capability while the RAF fast jets will protect the landings and the Army will mount helicopter air assaults across south west Scotland, but we know the Soviet spy trawlers are
 Russian daughter | Tatiana Kudinova tired | paid undercover police | murder => A Russian woman has been jailed after trying to hire a hitman to kill her daughter-in-law after she got fed up with her jokes. Tatiana Kudinova, 50, told police daughter-in-law Roxanne, 30, kept making fun of the fact that she was less well off, and decided she wanted her dead. However, the man Kudinova paid to kill Roxanne turned out to be an undercover police officer, and she was arrested. Murderous mother-in-law: Tatiana Kudinova, left, hired a hitman to kill her 30-year-old daughter-in-law Roxanne after she got tired of the latter making fun of her financial situation . Kudinova claims she fell out with her daughter-in-law after a party when the pair started arguing about who should pay for the food for the guests. After this, she says Roxanne kept making jokes about her being a 'skinflint mother-in-law', which irritated her so much she wanted her dead. Kudinova, from Rostov, southern Russia, then contacted a local criminal gang, offering them £1,200 to kill Roxanne. According to police, Kudinova told the gang; 'I don't care how she dies, I only want you to kill her' What she did not realise was that the man she paid a £600 deposit to was in fact an undercover policeman. Caught: The 'local criminal' Kudinova paid to kill her daughter-in-law was, in fact, an undercover police officer . Officers then devised an elaborate sting to catch Kudinova by faking Roxanne's death and taking photos of her 'corpse'. A police spokesman said: 'We needed to catch her in the act of paying for the murder and giving an advance payment was not enough. 'So we arranged for it to appear as though the daughter-in-law was dead, covered her in fake blood and took photos to convince the woman that the hit had taken place. 'She was arrested after handing over the rest of the money to one of of our undercover officers.\n\n . Appearing in court, the judge told her: 'You are an evil, callous woman who sought to destroy someone's life and ruin the happiness of your son. 'You did this because of a few jokes.' Kudinova was sentenced to nine years in prison.

 match Brisbane Roar Wellington Phoenix decision | 1 time clear result | rain Lang Park pitch unplayable | Frans Thijssen | abandoned => Monsoon-like conditions forced the abandonment of Sunday's A-League match between the Brisbane Roar and Wellington Phoenix - a decision that could have implications on the title race. After torrential rain had left the Lang Park pitch covered in large puddles, making even short passes difficult, referee Alan Milliner decided to bring things to a premature conclusion on 73 minutes. League leaders Phoenix were leading 2-1 at the time and move four points clear at the top of the table because the result was allowed to stand. Brisbane Roar's Andrija Kaluderovic and Wellington's Andrew Durrante struggle in atrocious conditions as torrential rain left the Lang Park pitch unplayable and forced an abandonment after 73 minutes . Luke Brattan takes a tumble to the waterlogged surface under pressure from Wellington's Vince Lia . Referee Alan Milliner explains his decision to abandon the contest to Roar player Matt McKay . The officials explain their decision to call off the game with 17 minutes remaining . But Roar coach Frans Thijssen reacted angrily to the decision to call off the match despite the wild weather turning proceedings into a farce. Brisbane are in contention for the play-offs and Thijssen criticised the rule that states a replay is required if the match is abandoned before half-time but the result stands if it ends after the break. He said: 'Of course I'm disappointed because this is a crazy end. 'I've never seen this, because the choice is replay if it happens in the first-half, they're the normal rules, and if it happens in the second-half you have to play the second-half again. Brisbane Roar players protest the referee's decision, having been 2-1 down at the time . Brisbane's Andrija Kaluderovic attempts to get a shot away on the deteriorating surface . Wellington's Alex Rodriguez (left) and Brisbane's Corey Brown splash through the puddles . 'We all want an honest competition and Adelaide and Perth, they're not happy with this because they are in a competition to be champions. 'And we're in a competition to be in the play-offs, so of course it's disappointing. 'When we had a free-kick in a dangerous position where we could score, they just call off the game and they give three points to one team and no points to the other team, that's not an honest competition.' Brisbane led after five minutes through Andrija Kaluderovic before Michael McGlinchey equalised for the visitors 10 minutes later. Then, moments before the half-time whistle, Australia international Nathan Burns pounced to put Wellington ahead. They are now four points ahead of Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Perth Glory, who are all tied on 38 points in second place.

 Joe getting carried away form goalkeeper | season Hart dropped | caps England => Joe Hart is not getting carried away with his current form and admits he could be the ‘worst goalkeeper in the world again’ by the next game. The 27-year-old put in a world class performance when Manchester City played Barcelona in the Champions League and pulled off a string of saves to keep his side in the game. Even though he was unable to prevent them being knocked out, the Barca players queued up to praise Hart afterwards. Joe Hart is refusing to get caught up in his own hype despite showing excellent form with his club of late . Manchester City goalkeeper Hart makes a save during training at St George's Park with the England squad . Hart drew praise from Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Luis Enrique despite City's European exit . Lionel Messi said: ’He was phenomenal, he stopped everything. We have to congratulate him on a great game because he's a fantastic goalkeeper.’ Andres Iniesta added: ‘Hart was key to keeping them in it and was great in one-on-one situations. He was outstanding.’ Barca head coach Luis Enrique also said: ‘The score could have been a rout but Hart was incredible.’ It is in stark contrast to the beginning of the season when Hart was dropped by City manager Manuel Pellegrini and replaced by Willy Caballero, but he has fought his way back. ‘I have always been aware that for all the good stuff, I could be the worst keeper in the world again in one game’s time,’ Hart said. ‘I don’t get too wrapped up in good stuff or bad stuff. I just focus on my game and keep working hard.’ The English keeper says that 'for all the good stuff' that he showed in Barcelona, his form could easily dip . Messi tries to find a way past Hart but despite a dominant performance Barca were restricted to a single goal . Neymar attempts to nip the ball away from Hart's clutches at the Nou Camp but again is denied . Hart will reach a half-century of caps if he plays against Lithuania and Italy in England’s next two games. To put that into context, Peter Shilton, England’s record cap holder with 125, was 31 years old by the time he reached that landmark. Hart added: ’I am honoured to play every single game I have done for England and for it to be 48 so far is fantastic but I just want to keep playing. There are plenty of other English goalkeepers who want to do the same and I am fully aware of that. I have got a lot of hard work to do to keep my place and I am willing to do that.’ Will Caballero took over the City No 1 spot from Hart briefly for a spell earlier this season at the Etihad . Peter Shilton was 31 when he won his 50th England cap, while Hart could win his against Italy next week .
 furnishing marijuana brownies welfare | occupation hemp farmer | issues therapist => Baked: Jennifer Becker, 49, from Maine, has been charged with furnishing marijuana-laced brownies and endangering the welfare of a child . A Maine woman has been arrested for allegedly giving her 13-year-old daughter brownies laced with marijuana. Jennifer Becker, 49, from Edgecomb, was arrested Monday and charged with furnishing marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child. The woman was taken into custody after the Maine Department of Health and Human Services received a complaint claiming that Becker gave her underage daughter baked goods containing cannabis. The divorced mother of one was taken to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset and later released on bail. A judge has ordered Becker to avoid contact with her 13-year-old daughter, who is now staying with her father in Florida. The mother is due back in court in April, reported Portland Herald Press. On her Facebook page, Becker listed her occupation as a hemp farmer; hemp is a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant and its related products. She is also a member of the New England HempCrete - a company that offers environmentally friendly building materials made out of hemp. Blame game: Becker said her daughter, who 'has issues' told her therapist about the pot-laced brownies, which eventually resulted in her arrest . In an interview with the local station WGME, Becker said her teenage daughter ‘has issues’ and that everything is ‘being blown out of proportion.’ ‘She confided to her therapist that she took some [pot brownies] and now here we are,’ the 49-year-old suspect stated. Maine legalized medical marijuana in 1999, and a decade later the state decriminalized cannabis when Governor John Baldacci signed a bill which made possession of 2.5 ounces or less a civil infraction. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. Green thumb: According to her Facebook page, the 49-year-old divorcee is a hemp farmer in Maine .
 goat | Cologne Ujah celebrated Frankfurt | mascot Hennes sidelines | international => Have you ever been so excited by scoring a goal that you felt the need to celebrate by aggressively pulling a goat by its horns? No, me neither, but Cologne's Nigerian forward Anthony Ujah certainly as the 24-year-old celebrated scoring his side's fourth goal against Frankfurt by doing exactly that. The goat involved was Cologne mascot Hennes VIII who was quietly minding his own business on the sidelines while watching the game with his handlers. Cologne's Nigerian forward Anthony Ujah celebrates his goal by man handling a goat against Frankfurt . The 24-year-old African striker ran over to the touchline to pull the goat by the horns during the match . The goats' handlers try to stop the Nigerian international from pulling the goat on to the football pitch . But Hennes peaceful afternoon in the German sun was short lived as he was rudely pulled away from his tasty grass to be part of one of the weirdest celebrations football has ever seen. Nigerian international Ujah slotted the ball neatly past Frankfurt's opposition goalkeeper before running to the sidelines screaming before pulling the goat all over the place by it's horns. Worried handlers appeared to try and stop the former Lillestrom player from pulling Hennes on to the pitch and he eventually let go as his teammates joined in the celebrations. The striker later celebrated on his own in a far more normal way following his goal against Frankfurt .
 police charged Tuesday criminal homicide inspection sticker | Hummelstown Mearkle David Kassick February 2 | struggled | thought jacket gun | remove gun => A police officer was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide after investigators concluded she shot an unarmed motorist in the back as he lay facedown after a traffic stop over an expired inspection sticker. Authorities accused Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J. Mearkle of shooting David Kassick, 59, twice February 2 without legal justification. She was jailed without bail. They said Mearkle had attempted to pull over Kassick for expired inspection and emissions stickers before he sped away. She caught up to Kassick near his sister's home, where he got out and ran. She had incapacitated him with a stun gun and he was on the ground when she shot him twice in the back, police said. Scroll down for video . An officer in handcuffs: Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J Mearkle was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide in the February 2 shooting death of David Kassick, 59. Mearkle pictured above (center) before her court hearing on Tuesday . Necessary? Prosecutors say Mearkle shot dead Kassick when he was lying facedown on the ground and didn't present any danger. She has contested that she saw him reach into his jacket - possibly for a weapon. However, he was unarmed. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday in handcuffs . Mearkle was later released on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device . Victim: Last month, one of Kassick's (pictured) brothers said he had struggled with drug addition but was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. He was working as a construction worker at the time of his death last month . Before the shooting: Mearkle above pictured in her Hummelstown, Pennsylvania police uniform . Mearkle, 36, told investigators she shot because he would not show her his hands and she thought he was reaching into his jacket for a gun. The stun gun recorded portions of the encounter, and District Attorney Ed Marsico called it the strongest evidence in the case. He said it appeared Kassick had been trying to remove stun-gun probes from his back. 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow covered lawn with his face toward the ground,' according to the arrest affidavit. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico said Mearkle performed CPR after the shooting. He called the shooting 'a tragedy for all involved.' In the wake of Tuesday's announcement, Kassick's younger brother Dale Kassick spoke out, saying: 'Nothing is going to bring my brother back. He should have never lost his life over a traffic stop.' However, Dale said he and the rest of his family were thankful for the community's support in the past month and the prompt filing of charges. 'It's not being swept under the rug, it's not being forgotten about,' Dale said. Last month, Kassick's older brother Dan said his brother had struggled with drug addition in his life. However, he said the construction worker was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. Scene: Above, a picture of the area where Kassick was shot on February 2, with police investigating . Serious allegations: Mearkle pictured above entered court on Tuesday, before the arraignment . The DA said a syringe was found near Kassick's body, and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. Mearkle's lawyer did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment, nor did Hummelstown Chief Charles M. Dowell. The police department issued a news release that said it had cooperated fully, calling the matter 'an extremely difficult case for all involved.' 'We are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,' the news release stated. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned. Mearkle was released this afternoon on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device at home. Important announcement: Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Mrisco announced the charges against Mearkle at an afternoon press conference on Tuesday .
 better Coalition came economy growing faster expected | performing economies including Japan | Labour repeatedly families £ 1 600 worse Leslie conceded living crawling | Car investment Wiltshire | Business investment 7.5 cent | cent | 2014 2006 | months | 2015 => The Conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators, which show UK is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006, which Chancellor George Osborne hailed as ‘a hat-trick of good news . Families are better off than when the Coalition came to power, the economy is growing faster than expected and consumers are more confident than they have been for more than 12 years, official figures revealed yesterday. On day two of the election campaign, the Conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators – crowned by Office for National Statistics figures showing Britain is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006. The UK is out-performing all other leading economies, including the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and France. In seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s: . Labour has repeatedly claimed that families are £1,600 a year worse off than they were when the Coalition came to power, but shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie last night conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago’. As David Cameron claimed the Tories would help business to create two million more jobs over the next five years if they remained in power, on top of 1.9 million since 2010, independent economists said the Government could boast a ‘remarkable’ record on employment. Car giant Honda announced a £200million investment in its Wiltshire plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up . Chancellor George Osborne hailed ‘a hat-trick of good news about the British economy’, insisting: ‘With 37 days to go until the election, it’s another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk. Voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos?’ Labour had planned to use Ronald Reagan’s famous question – ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago’ – as a central plank of its election campaign, but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise. Inflation has fallen to zero – its lowest level for more than half a century – and Britain looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices. Overall, it means the average British voter now has more cash to spend than they did at the 2010 election. Household spending per head also rose by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels of five years ago’ Yesterday’s ONS figures showed the economy has grown by more than 8 per cent since the last election, having crashed by 6 per cent in the so-called ‘Great Recession’ under Labour. The UK economy is now 3.7 per cent bigger than at any time in history. Business investment rose by 7.5 per cent last year to a record £179.7billion in an indication that companies are confident enough to spend for the future. And exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘Rescuing our economy was the main reason that the Liberal Democrats formed the Coalition. This upward revision in GDP is further evidence that our recovery plan is working.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the recovery had been the slowest in 100 years. ‘A small upward revision today in the GDP figures doesn’t change that overall record. This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn’t have to be this way,’ he said. Experts said Britain was on course for another strong year in 2015. Andrew Sentance, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘We should expect GDP forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data. It is still entirely possible that the UK will head the G7 growth league in 2015, as we did last year.’ However, in a setback for the Government, the services sector, which powers much of the economy, has slipped back. Output from services firms – which make up about 78 per cent of GDP and range from hotels to hairdressers – fell 0.2 per cent in January. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the services figures were ‘disappointing’ but described them as a ‘blip’. Labour claims... versus the reality: James Slack's analysis .

 Manny Pacquiao basketball Floyd Mayweather | passionate occasional coach | 100 push Man | said ups => Manny Pacquiao works up a sweat on a Los Angeles basketball court as the pint-sized Filipino's preparations for his May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather ramp up. In spite of his 5ft 6in frame Pacquiao is passionate about basketball and is even an occasional player-coach for the KIA Sorento team in the Philippine Basketball Association's league. So a reporter probably should have known better than to bet Pacquiao he couldn't nail a three-pointer on a crowded court in his United States base. Manny Pacquiao shoots hoops in Los Angeles as he prepares to take on Floyd Mayweather on May 2 . Reporter Elie Seckbach (green and white tracksuit) lost a 100 push-up bet that Pac-Man wouldn't nail a three . The video journalist, Elie Seckbach, said he'd do 100 push-ups if the 36-year-old sunk a maximum from the corner of the court and was good to his word. Pacquiao's shooting form up to that point was sketchy at best, with air balls as common as the sound of swish from the net, although he does sink a backwards shot from the free throw line. On winning the bet, the pound-for-pound legend even stands over the reporter at one point to ensure his push-ups are up to the superfit boxer's standards. Pacquiao shows his skills on the court as he works up a sweat during the countdown to the Las Vegas fight . Pacquiao makes a fool of this opponent as he dribbles through his legs in the video . Colourful reporter Seckbach has form in losing bets with Pacquiao having done the same back in 2010 when Pacquiao delivered a three-pointer in an organised local game. 'Manny Pacquiao - Do not bet him, you will not win,' he said after Pacquiao gave him a fist pump of approval after his push-ups were complete. Pacquiao is attracting a crowd wherever he goes in LA, his base ahead of the richest fight of all time, whether it's shadow boxing in a park or shooting hoops.
 school contacted Jennifer Marie Monday charged | campus act | teach boy church family | letter false => Arrest: Jennifer Perry, a first-year high school teacher, allegedly had sexual contact with a student . A 27-year-old married teacher has been arrested for allegedly engaging in a sex act with a 17-year-old student after she told the school there were 'false' rumors going around that they'd had a relationship. The school contacted authorities and Jennifer Marie Perry, from Odenville, Alabama, surrendered to the Jefferson County Jail on Monday and has been charged with sexual contact with a student under 19. Perry, who was in her first year of teaching at Pinson Valley High School, is accused of meeting the student at a parking lot a few miles from the campus on February 8 and engaging in a consensual sex act inside a car. She did not teach the boy but attends church with him and his family, said Sergeant Jack Self of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. She is believed to have known him before working for the school, he added. On February 23, she wrote a letter to school administrators and told them there was a false rumor going around school that she had sexual contact with a student. The school launched an investigation and found reason to believe the rumor was in fact true, Sergeant Self said. When they met with her on February 24, they said they would be passing their findings on to the school board and local authorities, and she handed in her resignation. The sheriff's office launched an investigation that day and spoke to the alleged victim as well as other students. Perry was not willing to speak with them, Sergeant Self said. Double-life: Perry met her husband, Blake (pictured) in their freshman year of high school and married in 2011. She did not teach her alleged victim but knew him and his family through church, authorities said . Authorities obtained a warrant against Perry and she turned herself in on Monday but was later released after posting $30,000 bond. She is now awaiting trial. Authorities believe the incident was a one-time occurrence, Sergeant Self said. The family of the alleged victim, who know Perry and her family, expressed their relief that she had been arrested, Sergeant Self said. Perry married her husband, Blake, in May 2011, according to Facebook. They met when they were freshman in high school and have been together ever since, she wrote on a bio on the school's website. They now live together with their three dogs. She is a graduate of Jacksonville State University and was in her first year of teaching at the school, according to the bio. She is listed as a ninth-grade English teacher. Probe: She wrote a letter to officials at Pinson Valley High School saying there was a false rumor going around about the incident. The school launched an investigation and they allegedly found evidence that it did occur . 'I am incredibly excited to be spending my first year as a Pinson Valley Indian spreading my love of literature with students,' she wrote. Speaking to AL.com, Chief Deputy Randy Christian expressed his shock that Perry had successfully navigated the competitive process of achieving a teaching job just to throw it away. 'It's also kind of amazing they believe it's possible a teen will keep their little secret,' he said. 'The school administration is to be commended for taking immediate action. That was helpful to us in bringing this to a close.'
 rules post intimate photos taken subject | site said verify complaints suspended | behaviour policy updated | Twitter user post | revenge people | internal Dick dealing abuse trolls => Twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators. But now it's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn. Under 'Private information' (pictured) the guidelines now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . The changes were spotted by BuzzFeedNews, which recently submitted a Q&A to Reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts. Twitter has used these questions to address the changes. Both Twitter's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes. Twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. In February a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in England and Wales. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are considering similar laws. Under the rules, revenge porn is considered: 'photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed, where what is shown would not usually be seen in public'. It covers images shared without the subject's permission and 'with the intent to cause harm. Offenders face up to two years in jail. This follows laws in sixteen US states - including Alaska, California, New Jersey and Texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. 'Users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well,' said the firm. 'Content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform. 'Users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from Twitter.' The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Reports recently claimed Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification. Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information.

 England second crack World Cup | runs | Hodgson | business => Roy Hodgson has told the Football Association he would like to continue as England manager for a further two years and have a second crack at the World Cup. Hodgson’s contract runs until next summer’s European Championship and no formal discussions have taken place to extend his deal. But Hodgson is enjoying the job, with his England side six points clear at the top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group after four straight wins. Roy Hodgson has told the FA he would like to continue as England manager for a further two years . Hodgson, Ray Lewington and Gary Neville during the disappointing World Cup in Brazil . The England manager and some of the player applaud supporters after their match against Costa Rica . He has told senior members of the FA that, even at 67, he does not feel ready to retire. Hodgson is said to feel he has unfinished business after such a disappointing World Cup in Brazil last year and he would like to put his experience to good use in Russia in 2018. Hodgson certainly has significant support at Wembley. He received the backing of FA chairman Greg Dyke after England’s early exit in Brazil and he also enjoys a close working relationship with Dan Ashworth, the FA technical director who worked with Hodgson at West Bromwich Albion. The FA will wait until a new chief executive has been appointed, who will, along with Dyke and Ashworth decide Hodgson’s future. Hodgson is said to feel he has unfinished business after such a disappointing World Cup in Brazil . With the array of young stars England have, Hodgson wants another chance at the World Cup in 2018 . Hodgson did receive the backing of FA chairman Greg Dyke after England’s early exit in Brazil . It could well be that the FA take the sensible option of delaying a final decision until after Euro 2016 in France. Recently Hodgson hinted publicly that he does not feel ready to retire. ‘At the moment I feel good and I don’t feel anything like my age,’ he said. ‘I hope that will continue for a few more years. ‘I am confident that I will know what the right time is. But I have an important job to do which I really enjoy, so as for 2018 and 2020 we will see.’
 Israel Gareth Bale Wales Real Euro 2016 qualifier | Bernabeu | 4 3 Schalke finals Champions League | March 28 => Israel coach Eli Guttman has claimed Gareth Bale cares more about Wales than Real Madrid ahead of his side's crunch Euro 2016 qualifier against the Dragons. Guttman's astonishing claim comes on the back of Real Madrid's dramatic slump in form and £85.3million world record signing Bale being booed by his own fans at the Bernabeu. The European champions suffered their fifth defeat of 2015 when they lost 4-3 at home to German side Schalke on Tuesday night, and although that was enough for Real to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League 5-4 on aggregate, it did not spare the players from the wrath of angry Madridistas. Gareth Bale endured a frustrating evening on Tuesday night but Real still qualified for the quarter-finals . Fans waved white handerkerchiefs - the traditional symbol of disgust at a bad performance - with Bale once again made the scapegoat for Real's problems. Bale was branded selfish and castigated in the Madrid media after choosing to shoot rather than pass to Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema against Espanyol in January and the Welshman has since suffered a dip in form with no goals or assists in his last eight games. And now Guttman has added fuel to the fire by insisting Bale is saving his best for Wales' visit to Israel on March 28, when the top two sides in Group B meet in Haifa. Bale celebrates scoring a late winner for Wales against Andorra back in September last year . Israel coach Eli Guttman (right) believes Bale (left) cares more for playing for his country than Real Madrid . 'I feel that Bale is saving himself for the national team,' Guttman told sports.walla.co.il. 'The level of the miles he does and the level of his commitment to the national team is nothing like how he plays for Real Madrid. 'When they had a player injured [George Williams, who revealed he is out for six months after requiring knee ligament surgery] Bale was the first to [tweet] 'get well soon'. 'They are like us, they are one group, but Bale is the one that gives them balance.' The Welshman, playing against Schalke on Tuesday, has struggled for form in recent weeks for Los Blancos . Cristiano Roanldo scored twice as the Champions League holders advanced 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday . Israel and Wales are the early surprise front-runners in Group B, with Guttman's leaders having won their opening three games against Cyprus, Andorra and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second-placed Wales are a point behind Israel and unbeaten after four games, and confidence is high in Chris Coleman's squad after the goalless draw against group favourites Belgium in Brussels in November. Guttman admits that stopping Bale is key to Israel staying top of the section, but he takes heart from keeping the Welshman's Real team-mate Ronaldo off the scoresheet in a 3-3 draw in Tel Aviv two years ago. Real Madrid fans were pictured waving handkerchiefs after the final whistle against Schalke on Tuesday . In that 2014 World Cup qualifier, only an injury-time equaliser from Portugal full-back Fabio Coentrao prevented Israel from recording a famous victory. 'I remember how Sheran Yeini [Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder] was able to stop Ronaldo.' Guttman said. 'Whenever Ronaldo was on the side of the pitch, somebody else guarded him. 'We have to be close and don't let Bale empty space. If we won't do it, it will kill us.'
 Analyse user emotional upbeat depressed styles | Katy Perry => Whether you use it to share news and emotions, or to complain about brands, what you write on Twitter may say more about you than you think. Now, an interactive tool can analyse your most recent tweets and its creator claims it can reveal your personality, by looking at how you use words. Called Analyse Words, it generates a user’s emotional style and says whether they are upbeat, worried, angry or depressed, as well as revealing someone’s social and thinking styles. Try the interactive tool below . Use the interactive tool above to analyse your most recent tweets and reveal your personality . The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. To get results, users simply have to enter their Twitter handle and press a button that says 'Analyse Tweets'. A results page is then generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. But most intriguingly it tells users how upbeat, worried, angry and depressed they are, in terms of percentages. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas the tweets of people who are predominantly worried contain anxious words and nervous questions. The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. These are the results for Barack Obama, which show he is very upbeat and quite analytical . By inputting a Twitter handle, such as a celebrity's a result page is generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. It can be used to show the difference between people's emotional, social and thinking styles. For example, President Obama (left) is upbeat, while Katy Perry (right) is depressed . Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet. Tweets by worried users are dominated by anxious words and nervous questions. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals. Depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals and people who have a high depression score make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant or spacy. 'Plugged in' tweeters are socially engaged and use social words as well as talking to specific friends, according to the tool. Personable people use positive emotional words, pose questions and reference others frequently, while those who are 'arrogant or distant' tend to be well-read with 'an arms-length approach to socialising'. 'You scored high in this category if you discuss actions instead of emotions, use big words and don’t reference yourself much,' it says. Twitter users who score highly in being a 'spacy valley girl' are excitable and have a habit of tweeting LOLLLLLs, the tool says. It also analyses user's thinking styles and tells them to what extent their tweets show they are analytical, sensory or how they seem to live in the moment. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals, while depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Singer Katy Perry's results are shown, which says she is depressed . Dr Pennebacker has previously developed a computer program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) which looks at the choice, frequency and context of words to gauge a person’s psychological state, Maria Konnikova writes for the New Yorker. 'Since the creation of the LIWC, in 1993, studies utilising the program have suggested a close connection between our language, our state of mind, and our behaviour,’ she writes. For example, one study showed that the words used on a date can predict people’s desire to be with someone, or in another situation can indicate a person’s importance at work or even their sex and mental state. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant, meaning distant, and or spacy. Kanye West's results are shown above, which show he is mostly personable . A study by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania last month revealed that words used in social media profiles can help determine parts of the US that are more likely to have high numbers of deaths due to heart disease. Psychologist Johannes Eichstaedt led a team that analysed 826million tweets from 1,400 counties in the US for words associated with anger, anxiety and other emotions, to emotionally profile users. They found that counties where people’s tweets included hostile, aggressive and lazy words, such as ‘jealous’ and ‘bored’ had higher rates of death from heart attacks and strokes, whereas places with more positive tweeters had less. This suggests that negative and angry language used on social media could be used to predict medical conditions, but the field of research is young.
 capped James Corden | fake new host Late Late => David Beckham has long been known as a fashion icon, with billboard campaigns almost as common as England appearances during the later years of his career. Now, England's most capped outfield player is posing again, this time alongside comedian James Corden, in a less orthodox shoot. Beckham's chiselled physique is placed alongside Corden's rather fuller frame in a fake advert filmed for the comedian's new role as host of CBS' 'Late Late Show'. James Corden (right) joins David Beckham for their spoof 'D+J briefs' advert on his new show . The comedian poses with former England star Beckham during the short clip for CBS' 'Late Late Show' Both men narrate over the video, with Beckham claiming 'beauty is skin deep - it's underneath that counts' while Corden dances around him. And Beckham also gets a bit of the 'hairdryer treatment' - though not in quite the same way he used to face it from former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The shoot ends with Corden giving the tagline: 'D+J briefs. Underwear for a man with a great body... and David Beckham'. Beckham is now stranger to modelling underwear, but this could be a first for Corden . The two men voice over the short clip, with Corden hugging and dancing around Beckham .

 Burnley Danny Ings Wednesday Premier League linked | Sportsmail | scored times | flourish guidance Rodgers => Burnley striker Danny Ings will step out at Anfield on Wednesday looking to boost his side's Premier League survival hopes at the expense of the team he has been strongly linked with a move to at the end of the season. Brendan Rodgers has refused to be drawn on speculation suggesting that Ings, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, will move to Liverpool. But if he does sign a contract at Anfield, will he be good enough to make the grade? Sportsmail's reporters give their verdict. Danny Ings (centre) has been Burnley's star player as they try to stay in the Premier League this season . DOMINIC KING . Yes, he is good enough to make the step up. It is no mean effort scoring nine goals in the Barclays Premier League for a side that has struggled to get results and Ings has never been found wanting at the biggest stadiums. He was outstanding in Burnley’s 3-1 loss at Old Trafford last month, his energy and intensity setting him apart that night. It was not a one-off because he has attracted positive reviews all season. Ings scored for Burnley against Manchester United in his side's 3-1 defeat and impressed with his display . Ings could replace Fabio Borini at Liverpool, with the Italian expected to depart at the end of the season . Ings has scored nine times for Burnley this season and will take on Liverpool on Wednesday . Read Dominic King's piece on why Danny Ings would flourish under the guidance of Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . Liverpool will overhaul their striking department in the summer, with potentially three players moving – Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Mario Balotelli – and a move for Ings would make sense from both a playing style and an economic point of view. He will have to raise his game again should he eventually arrive at Anfield, but that won’t be a problem. Ings has been doing that for the last two years and he will welcome the challenge. JOE BERNSTEIN . Danny Ings is one of those players who doesn't have one quality that makes him stand out, but he doesn't have an obvious weakness either. He is an intelligent player and at 22 has the potential to get better. He is a good finisher but his tally of nine this season is unremarkable and five fewer than Charlie Austin at QPR for example. Ings watches on as his shot hits the back of the net for Burnley against Queens Park Rangers . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has refused to comment on the speculation linking the club with Ings . Ings can show he is capable of playing on the big stage when he plays for Burnley against Liverpool . Ings could make the step up to a big club but there is no guarantee. You suspect Liverpool's real interest in him is due to John W Henry's moneyball approach to the game. Why wouldn't you take a promising 22-year-old on a Bosman given you could sell him in two years for a handsome profit, even if he doesn't become a first-team regular? IAN LADYMAN . There was a moment when it became clear to me that Ings was good enough to make the grade at the very highest level and it came early in last month’s defeat at Manchester United. The way he showed Chris Smalling to the front post before checking back and heading in Burnley’s goal – by now unmarked – at the far post told you everything you need to know about his natural instincts as a goal scorer. It was high-class finishing. Ings' form has also led to talk that England manager Roy Hodgson (left) will include him in his next squad . Ings beats defender Martin Kelly and goalkeeper Julian Speroni to score against Crystal Palace . Earlier in the season – as he started the campaign slowly – I wasn’t sure but he has found his feet now and has emerged as a safe bet for the next England squad. On that note, I wrote a story last season saying that Ings was being watched by Roy Hodgson’s staff and was likely to figure in the national set-up during the Euro qualifiers. I remember one of my colleagues laughing. He isn’t laughing any more…. CHRIS WHEELER . There’s no doubting the drive and determination of a striker who was playing for Dorchester Town in the Conference South a little over four years ago, and Ings will be desperate to put on a performance at Anfield. Is he good enough to make the step up to Liverpool? Compared with the players Brendan Rodgers currently has at his disposal, you would have to say yes. Ings has scored nine goals in the Premier League for a Burnley side that has spent the entire season battling the odds – the same amount as Manchester City’s new £25m signing Wilfried Bony and Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, and more than Liverpool forwards Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Lazar Markovic put together. Ings has scored the same number of Premier League goals as Wilfried Bony and Olivier Giroud . Ings is only 22 and fits the profile of player that Liverpool often pursue in the transfer market . A player who scored 26 goals in the Championship last season has also hit four in seven appearances for England Under 21s to stake his claim for a senior international call-up, so there is little doubt that he is capable of rising to the challenge. Ings is not excessively tall or powerful, but he is quick and possesses great movement and anticipation in and around the penalty box. Most importantly of all, he has a goalscorer’s instinct. And at the age of 22, he is young enough to take his game to another level under a coach like Rodgers.
 military U.S. | UK government | 10 => (CNN)Look to the skies above London and you'll see the usual suspects -- rainclouds, planes and pigeons. But by the end of the year, you might just see something else. Longer than a soccer pitch and filled to the brim with helium, at 302 feet long, the Airlander 10 will be the world's biggest aircraft. Part blimp, part plane, part helicopter, it was originally created by British design company Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) for military surveillance by the U.S. Army. But budget cuts doomed the project and HAV bought the airship back across the pond, where it seemed set to remain on solid ground until the company received a £3.4 million ($5.1 million) grant from the UK government. Thanks to this recent injection of financing, designers and engineers are now readying the craft for first flight tests scheduled for later this year. While the concept has been around for nearly a century, airships fell out of fashion following the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, when the German passenger craft erupted into flames while trying to dock, killing 36. While an airship might seem like a craft from a time long passed, it has been given a 21st century design overhaul and HAV hopes to have airships back in the skies over the UK by 2016. Chris Daniels, HAV head of partnerships and communications, said: "The sole problems existing old-style airships had (were) having lots of ground crew, limited ability to carry payloads and to be susceptible to weather conditions. We solved all those problems with a new concept -- a hybrid aircraft. So a mix between a wing and an airship." The Airlander 10 -- named because it can carry 10 tons -- is made of a bespoke fabric of carbon fiber, kevlar and mylar, while the pressure of the helium inside maintains the aircraft's shape. Diesel fuel helps the Airlander take off and land and powers the propellers. The spacious cockpit is currently configured to accommodate a pilot and one observer but Daniels says this can easily be reconfigured to end-user specifications. The airship also has green credentials -- its creators say the current version uses 20% fuel burn of existing aircraft, can be fitted with solar panels, uses near-silent 325 hp V8 engines and can stay airborne for five days while carrying its maximum payload. The vehicle can also operate in extreme weather conditions (+54 to -56 degrees Celsius). While the previous U.S. Army project had military applications in mind, this time HAV plans to split end use 60:40 between civlian and military applications. Daniels says that they've had incredible interest from at home and abroad. The U.S. Coastguard has expressed interest in using the hybrid airships to monitor the nation's coastline. Meanwhile Swedish firm OceanSky, in conjunction with the government, wants to use the Airlander as an air transport system for wind turbines. Daniels explained: "At the moment, the only way of doing (transporting the equipment) is basically plowing a 50m-wide highway through pristine Nordic forest, which is not a good thing to do and they don't want to destroy ecological environment." Showing the versatility in air transport operations the airship could have, Daniels said the charity Oxfam is keen to task the aircraft on aid relief missions following natural disasters, while HAV is in talks with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to help conduct scientific research. Using airships for military purposes such as reconnaissance and surveillance is not a new idea and today faces stiff competition from drones. Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of AEROSPACE Magazine, said: "The Airlander does have one big benefit over UAVs. It can lift a heavier payload than most drones so allows for radars, better cameras, multiple sensors, etc. Payload weight is one of biggest limiters of UAVs -- so that would be extremely attractive to militaries looking to put larger or heavier sensors on board. It is also manned (piloted) which gives it more flexibility in being able to deploy to where it is needed." Robinson also highlighted commercial possibilities for the Airlander, such as long-range cargo airships and humanitarian missions. "The ability of the airship not to need runways or airports would be very attractive for disaster relief. While helicopters can also land anywhere, they are limited in payload and range -- plus the Airlander is much more efficient thanks to its hybrid 'lifting body' design." He added: "Imagine a large airship being able to land with a medical emergency department on board, right at the scene of the disaster." But the aviation expert is also cautiously optimistic about the future of the Airlander. He said there had been several "false dawns" in bringing about the return of the airship in previous years, including two military surveillance airship projects from the U.S. Pentagon which were ultimately sidelined "because they weren't confident in the technology." While Robinson calls it "the most promising lighter-than-air vehicle project we have seen in a long time," only successful first flight tests at the end of the year and further demos and trials will show off the Airlander 10's true capabilities. Until then, keep your eyes fixed to the horizon, where you might just see the future of aviation re-emerge through the clouds. More from Tomorrow Transformed .
 apologised playing Scrabble | Elengorn game Tory Council | said incident playing | Helen noticed => A Lib Dem councillor has apologised 'unreservedly' after he was caught playing Scrabble during a meeting. Martin Elengorn was snapped playing the game on his iPad by a Tory rival on Richmond Council who circulated the picture among council colleagues. Councillor Elengorn spent ten minutes playing Scrabble at the budget meeting before a party colleague passed him a note warning he had been rumbled. Martin Elengorn was snapped playing the game on his iPad by a Tory rival on Richmond Council who circulated the picture among council colleagues . And the 70-year-old admitted the furore that followed has put him off the game. He told the MailOnline that he had 'sought solace' in the app during an opening speech by Conservative deputy council leader Geoffrey Samuel. 'Councillor Samuel was giving a speech in a bombastic and aggressive manor and, to be somewhat blunt, I'd run our of budget agendas and I unwisely sought solace in the Scrabble board,' he said. 'I admit it could be seen as (not representing those who voted for him). I do apologise unreservedly if it created the wrong impression. The councillor and keen Scrabble player said the incident had put him off playing the game for the foreseeable future . 'In fact I was listening to every word he said.' Mr Samuel, who was opening the annual budget and council tax meeting, called Mr Elengorn's behaviour 'outrageous'. 'He is paid, not an inconsiderable amount of money, to represent his residents and not play silly games. 'This is typical of his arrogant attitude and the flippant way he takes his public duties. 'If it was me, I would consider stepping down.' Conservative councillor Helen Hill, who took the photograph, said she was 'shocked' when she noticed him playing the game. Councillor Helen Hill (left) was 'shocked' to see Councillor Elengorn (right) playing Scrabble during the budget meeting and took the photograph . 'It was certainly a bit of a surprise,' she said. 'I didn't think it as a great idea to do right in he middle of a council meeting for the budget.' Councillor Hill said she decided to take the photograph as 'a comment on what he was doing when he should have been listening. 'He is just an eccentric individual,' she added. Lib-Dem leader Stephen Knight said: 'I think Martin recognises it was not the wisest thing to be doing in a council meeting. Tory MP Nigel Mills was forced to apologise after he was caught playing games on his iPad during a select committee hearing last December - as the Commons authorities launched a mole hunt for whoever caught him on camera. Photographs published by The Sun showed Nigel Mills enjoying online hit Candy Crush Saga during a Work and Pensions Committee evidence session. The Amber Valley MP, who has been issued with a tablet at the taxpayers' expense, initially told the newspaper he would merely 'try' not to be diverted by the game again. But in a statement he said: 'I apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a Member of Parliament.' 'But I'd like to think people would be more interested in the content of the meeting than whether people were playing Scrabble.' Councillor Elengorn, who was a 'competent' Scrabble player said the whole incident had put him off wanting to play again. 'I have a routine, once a fortnight my brother and I play Scrabble- but he usually wins.' 'But I didn't look at the game again for a few days after this, I was rather put off it for a while.' John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Councillors receive a hefty allowance to represent the views of their constituents and hold the council to account — neither of which are achieved by playing Scrabble.' A spokesman for Richmond Council said they would not be commenting on the incident. It comes just weeks after Conservative councillor Eric Nicholson came underfire for spending two hours on his mobile phone during a debate at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria. The member for Cockermouth North played solitaire, checked his bank account and caught up with emails while hiding his Blackberry under the table during the meeting where a rise in council tax was being discussed. Mr Nicholson, who was elected in 1997, admitted after the meeting that he had been using his phone but insisted he was still 'concentrating'. Two months earlier, Tory MP Nigel Mills admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad during an important meeting in Parliament. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee in December. However, he spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen as he tried to complete levels of the popular game.
