INPUT: Lt Gen HR McMaster told ABC News there was consensus with China that this was a situation that "could not continue". The comments come after a failed missile test launch by North Korea and a massive military parade. President Trump had earlier said China was "working with us" on the issue. Beijing, Pyongyang's biggest ally, has come under pressure from Washington to exert more pressure on its neighbour. Sunday's comments appear to be the first confirmation that both countries are working together on how to deal with the North Korean issue. Gen McMaster, who was in the Afghan capital, Kabul, said the latest launch "fits a pattern of provocative and destabilising and threatening behaviour". "The president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons," he said. "I think there's an international consensus now, including the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just can't continue." President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed North Korea during a meeting last week. Mr Xi offered co-operation on "communication and co-ordination", the BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai reports. Earlier on Sunday, South Korean and US military officials said a North Korean missile had detonated soon after launch. The US Pacific Command said it believed it to be a ballistic missile. Investigations were continuing, but one unnamed US official said it was unlikely to have been an intercontinental (ICBM) missile. Ballistic missiles follow high trajectories and are initially powered and guided, but fall to their target under gravity. ICBMs follow a sub-orbital trajectory, others stay within the atmosphere. North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM that can reach targets around the world. Pyongyang has claimed to have miniaturised nuclear warheads for use on missiles, though experts have cast doubt on that given the lack of evidence. The state has already conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in contravention of UN resolutions. It has suffered test failures in the past but they have not deterred its development programme. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence is on a 10-day</s>

INPUT: Defence barrister Stephen Vullo made the announcement to the jury at Southwark Crown Court in London. The entertainer denies four charges relating to alleged assaults on three teenage girls between 1971 and 1983. Mr Harris, 87, was released from prison on Friday and is now appearing in the dock in person, having appeared via a video link in the trial's first week. Kenneth Jeacle, Mr Harris's former tour manager, told the court via video link from Australia he had seen parents encourage their children to "perhaps sit on his knee or perhaps give him a kiss on the cheek". But he said that Mr Harris was never the "instigator" of such behaviour. Mr Jeacle, who worked with the defendant from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, said: "Mr Harris's attitude in these incidents was always that people would approach him. "He would then perhaps open his arms and embrace them but in, shall I say, a fraternal or brotherly style or manner." Mr Vullo asked him whether he had ever seen Harris act inappropriately with his fans, and Mr Jeacle replied: "Categorically, never. "Mr Harris was, in my presence, constantly respectful of children and parents alike." Mr Harris is accused of groping a 14-year-old girl during a music event at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1971. Two further charges relate to alleged indecent assaults on a teenager in 1978, during filming for ITV celebrity show Star Games. The fourth relates to a 13-year-old girl who claims he touched her breast after filming BBC children's TV programme Saturday Superstore in 1983. Second defence lawyer David Patience read to the jury statements from people who attended the events. They included those who denied seeing or hearing anybody upset or anything of concern taking place. One was from ex-EastEnders and Coronation Street actress Rula Lenska, who was at Star Games. She said: "I can say, hand on heart, I never witnessed anything untoward or suspicious." Another woman, who was five when she attended the It's a Knockout-style event in 1978, said the "incredibly sweet" Mr Harris sat down next to her on a bench and gave her a cartoon.

INPUT: In the case of Baldock Town, that job has this season fallen to injured defender Liam Kenna. But his updates from the dugout during their FA Cup preliminary qualifying round tie against North Greenford United came to abrupt halt when he was sent on as a substitute with 10 minutes remaining. And the absence of his tweets prompted him to post an apology on behalf of the club the following day, which quickly went viral. "The secretary used to do it, but he left at the end of last season and because I have a bad back I've been doing it," the 29-year-old told BBC Sport. "I tweet every chance, every goal, every yellow card, I do it constantly." Kenna, from Llanelli, has not played this season because of his injury, but after only two or three light training sessions he was named among the substitutes. "There was a 90% chance I wasn't going to get on, but the centre-half got injured with 10 minutes left and we'd already used the other two subs," Kenna continued. "When I went to see the linesman to get my studs checked, I still had my phone in my hand. He said 'you can't go on with that mate'." The South Midlands League Division One side were 3-1 ahead when Kenna joined the action and held on to win by the same scoreline, but his lack of recent game-time took a physical toll. "I only touched the ball two or three times. I couldn't get round the pitch and couldn't breathe afterwards," he said. Former England striker Kevin Phillips and ex-Arsenal midfielder Ian Allinson both played for the original Baldock Town, which eventually folded in 2001. The current club was formed two years later and are now tenants at Arlesey's Town's Armadillo Stadium five miles away, having previously ground shared with Hitchin and Stotfold. Their reward for beating North Greenford is a home tie against Thame United of the Southern League over the weekend of the 9-10 September. And the FA have offered to do Baldock's tweeting for them so Kenna can concentrate on playing. He is no stranger to glory after captaining former club Welwyn Garden City to a league and cup</s>

INPUT: Official figures have shown a total of 72.4% of red calls were reached within eight minutes in December. It follows a new year-long pilot to test changes to the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust's patient response. In November, nearly 71% of code red calls were responded to compared with the 65% target. The new pilot, implemented in October, measures the results of treatment and patients' overall experience in a bid to make sure they receive the most appropriate care. The Emergency Ambulance Services Committee, which oversees the compilation of the data, said Wales now has the most detailed information on ambulance performance across the UK. The new data, for October to December, showed that out of 69,686 patients taken to hospital or another destination by ambulance, the vast majority - 63,694 - went to A&E. Ambulance crew handed over 58.2% of cases to hospital staff within the target time of 15 minutes, yet 12,233 hours were lost due to delays. Since a new traffic light system for grading calls was introduced, call centre staff have been given more time to determine the nature of the emergency. Of the total number of emergency calls received in December, 1,927 (5.0%) were red - "immediately life threatening" - the figures showed. Of those, more than 90% of red calls received a response within 15 minutes, but seven responses took longer than 30 minutes to arrive. Amber calls, deemed serious but not life threatening, do not have a target time but 65% were responded to within 15 minutes and 23 seconds. Emergency response time figures for November cannot be compared to December's as revised changes where introduced on 11 November, meaning a 999 call is now upgraded to a red category if the patient deteriorates. Tracy Myhill, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said they were "committed to learning and improving from this pilot as we move forward". Deputy health minister Vaughan Gething said it was "encouraging" to see "continuing improvement". "The new clinical response model is helping to ensure people get the right care, in the right place, at the right time," he said. However, he called for improvements in Powys and Hywel Dda health boards' performances, as both failed to reach the 65% emergency response target. Welsh Liberal Democrats leader</s>

In future, it is planned, it will also go on show in Kirkcudbright - closer to the spot it was discovered. It was September 2014 when metal detectorist Derek McLennan made the discovery of a lifetime on land in Dumfries and Galloway. Buried at the beginning of the 10th Century, some of the artefacts date back to an even earlier period. The hoard brings together the richest collection of rare Viking-age objects ever found in Britain. "It is very exciting to finally have the hoard on display," said NMS senior curator Dr Martin Goldberg, "To see it all laid out together for the first time is a real eye-opener for me - just seeing how much there is." He said a small treasure vessel in particular had produced some remarkable finds. "It is amazing - it is only 10cm high and 10cm in diameter - but the amount of things that were packed into it that we can now put on display," he said. The range of items spread out across the glass cabinets on display is impressive - the bulk of it silver jewellery and ingots. A tiny, gold, bird-shaped pin is particularly eye-catching as well as a number of brooches - some of a kind never previously found in Scotland. The temporary display of the hoard - which runs until October - is aimed at helping to raise funds towards the nearly <unk> £2m required to "save it for the nation". That process has not been without controversy. Dumfries and Galloway Council had put in a bid to secure the hoard for a new art gallery being built in Kirkcudbright but that was ultimately unsuccessful, despite going to appeal.

INPUT: The Shakespeare Schools Festival - an initiative which inspires schoolchildren to perform abridged versions of the playwright's famous work. From small beginnings, the initiative has grown into the UK's largest youth drama festival. And as the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death is marked on 23 April, we take a look back at its inception. "It all started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989," co-founder Chris Grace explained. As S4C's co-founder and director of animation, he had already made a name for himself kickstarting the Welsh animation industry with SuperTed and Fireman Sam. But as eastern Europe opened up, he was inspired by innovative Soviet techniques which used models, drawings and oil on glass. "I knew there was a Soviet tradition of animation which was totally different to Disney and it opened my eyes to new ways of making content accessible," he said. "I saw that Shakespeare could be a bridge between east and west; between Soviet tradition and western tradition." Working in Moscow, he helped to create 12 half-hour abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays - not an easy task when trying to maintain the original dialogue - with each one costing £500,000 to make. It was a turbulent time, with production surviving two attempted presidential coups - against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 and Boris Yeltsin in 1993. On one occasion, filming had to be stopped as tanks rumbled by outside, shaking the studio. On another, the studio came under fire from rebels, with bullet holes peppering the walls. "It was very exciting on one level because it was a new Europe," he said. "But it was also fearful. You didn't know the price of bread let alone what the cost of production was. "Despite this, we established a really strong production and international friendship between Wales and Russia." The 12 films, known as S4C's Shakespeare: The Animated Tales, were created in Welsh and English. Initially launched at the Royal Academy in London and City Hall in Cardiff, they went on to be released in 70 countries and won three Emmy awards. By the late-1990s, the films had a "huge up-take" in schools, introducing pupils to Shakespeare "for the very first time". "Every</s>

INPUT: On-loan Sam Gallagher looked to have won it on his first start for Rovers, heading in Craig Conway's corner. But Naylor met Matty Palmer's left-wing corner to seal a dramatic point. Conway had put Rovers ahead in the first half with a 25-yard drive that flew in off the bar, but Burton levelled with Jackson Irvine's header. A first-ever meeting between the two sides saw Rovers teenage academy product Scott Wharton handed a debut and he made an important early intervention to deflect John Mousinho's header wide. But after Conway took a Danny Graham pass to rifle in the 12th goal of his Rovers career, Burton, who did not include new loan signing John Brayford in their squad, were level just before the break as Mousinho's right-wing cross was met by an unmarked Irvine. Rovers started the second half brightly, only for Hope Akpan to head over a Conway free-kick, before Albion were unlucky when Naylor's long range drive crashed against the crossbar. Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, nodded in at the near post to put Rovers back in front, but Naylor was not to be denied to heap more pressure on Coyle, whose side are bottom of the Championship and the only club in the division still without a league win. Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "Having got ourselves ahead twice in the game, we could have seen it out and got the three points we were worthy of. "We all know it can be a cruel game but, having said that, there were a lot of positives we can take from the game - not least the performance of young Scott Wharton at the back on his debut." Rovers striker Sam Gallagher: "I was on the highest high from scoring my goal and then gutted when they got the equaliser. "I felt we deserved more, but at least we showed more character than in our other three games and we are off the mark." Burton manager Nigel Clough: "As pleasing as it is to get an 88th-minute equaliser, we are disappointed not to have won the game. "We looked a real threat from set-plays and we deserved at least a point." Match ends</s>

INPUT: Geoffrey Sutcliffe admitted causing the death of Lucille Abraham, 92. When applying to renew his driving licence, a court heard, Sutcliffe said he met the "required eyesight standard" and did not need glasses to drive. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. Sutcliffe hit Ms Abraham, from Baildon, at the junction of Godwin Street and Kirkgate, in Bradford, last October. During an eye test the previous month, Prosecutor Michael Smith said, Sutcliffe told the optometrist he was not a driver. Had he done so, Mr Smith said, she would have said that his eyesight had failed the visual acuity test. "The defendant suffers from cataracts in both eyes and it seems that the medical opinion here is that he should not undergo an operation on his right eye because effectively that's the only eye that can see," said Mr Smith. Barrister Ken Green, for Sutcliffe, said he had been driving for over 60 years without any previous offending and his client intended never to drive again and had surrendered his licence.

Wear and tear, as well as damage caused by a lack of maintenance in homes are also key reasons for claims being rejected, an insurers' group said. In contrast, 99% of motor insurance claims result in a payout. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has published the industry-wide figures for the first time, after analysis of claims made during 2013 and 2014. The success rate figures are based on 6.9 million claims handed by 19 insurers, including 4.3 million motor insurance claims, 1.8 million home insurance claims, and 800,000 travel insurance claims. The analysis showed that 79% of home insurance policyholders who made a claim were successful, receiving a typical payout of <unk> £2,520. Of those whose claims were turned down, some made claims that were valued below the policy excess and others had bought the wrong kind of cover. Many home insurance policies have add-ons that cover certain eventualities, but add extra complexity to renewals. Many were denied due to a failure to maintain their property. For example, roof damage caused by a storm that affects numerous homes in an area is likely to be successful.

The criticism from abroad, that Russia is actually ignoring IS targets to focus on opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, is dismissed as propaganda. "This is truly a matter of national security," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a packed press room this week. "We've experienced terrorism. We don't want to go through that again." As the vast majority of Russians get their news from TV, the message is starting to penetrate. A poll this week by the independent Levada centre in Moscow revealed that 72% of Russians support the airstrikes. That is a dramatic turn-around since the last survey before the military and media campaigns began, when a majority were opposed. It is a reassuring result for Vladimir Putin, for whom the Syria campaign is another chance to play the strong man and reassert Russia on the global power map. The first cruise missiles modern Russia has ever launched in combat were fired on his 63rd birthday; the dramatic images were screened repeatedly, almost like celebratory fireworks. The next day's newspapers hailed the barrage as proof that Russia is back to rival the USA, after President Putin's massive investment in a military modernization drive. But the Levada centre survey revealed another important statistic. "There is a clear fear that Russia will get stuck in Syria, like the Soviet Union did in Afghanistan; that this will be a long campaign, with human sacrifice and great cost," the centre's director Lev Gudkov points out. That is despite repeat assurances that Russia will not deploy ground troops. "The Kremlin is underlining that this is a short-term operation, and only from the air.

INPUT: Researchers suggest there is poor evidence to support screening and isolating infected patients - standard practice in hospitals worldwide. But good hand hygiene and bathing with antibacterial solutions are key to reducing infections, they say. Experts warn more studies are needed before any change in protocols. Despite rates of Meticillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) falling in many countries, concerns about its spread remain. The bug is resistant to most antibiotics and while it is can be carried harmlessly on the skin it may lead to serious wound infections - particularly in people who are already unwell. Hospitals have used a varied combination of methods to tackle it, including: Scientists reviewed studies over the last decade. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good. Prof Gerd Fatkenheuer, from the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, who was part of the research team said: "In the haste to do something against the rising tide of MRSA infection, measures were adopted that seemed plausible but were not properly assessed, bundling the effective and harmless with the ineffective and harmful. "We know for example that isolating patients can result in anxiety and depression and fewer visits by doctors and nurses." The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. Prof Peter Collignon at the Canberra Hospital, Australia said: "Certain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. "So we need to make sure that studies clearly show that we will not do harm by stopping some or all of these isolation methods." The report authors say as MRSA levels continue to drop this provides a good opportunity to reassess how best to tackle the problem. And they recommend scarce resources could be redeployed to combat other infections - rather than singling out MRSA. Recent figures for England suggest 862 cases of MRSA were recorded in the year 2013-14, a substantial reduction from the 4,451 cases reported in 2007-08.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>

"This is a hell of a shock, he'd been gigging frequently despite having a life that was quite extreme, and he was certainly in extremely good health, performing concerts and seemingly pretty much at the top of his game," he said. Cornell was born on 20 July 1964. As a solo artist, he released four studio albums - most recently 2015's Higher Truth.

INPUT: Former Humberside Police Det Ch Supt Colin Andrews allegedly carried out the rape in a hotel room in December 2003. The 58-year-old pleads not guilty to seven charges including rape, stalking and harassment. Manchester Crown Court heard he denied putting his hand over the mouth of a woman while he raped her. Cross-examining Mr Andrews, prosecutor Owen Edwards said to him: "You wanted sex whether she wanted it or not." The father-of-one replied: "No. that's not me." Mr Edwards then asked: "You got on top of her didn't you?" "No, there was no sex at all, of that I am certain. No sex that night, absolute fact," replied Mr Andrews. Mr Edwards said: "When she screamed you put your hand on her mouth and had sex with her. Is that rape?" "I would say so but that is not what happened. I did not rape her, that did not happen," replied Mr Andrews. "I have never put my hand on any female's mouth ever during sex. "Whatever she's describing, I never had sex with her. I never attempted to have sex with her. I have never forced myself on anyone, I would never do that." Since the start of the trial, the court has heard Mr Andrews described as "controlling, manipulative and bullying". The jury has been told the defendant held his hand over the woman's mouth while he raped her. They also heard accusations of him pursuing a campaign of stalking and harassment against another woman in the summer of 2013, during which he sent thousands of text messages and emails. Giving evidence in his defence on Thursday, the former detective broke down in court as he told the jury about his early police career. The court also heard how he was the force's most decorated officer and was described as "loyal and dedicated" by a former colleague. Mr Andrews also denies two counts of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and witness intimidation. The trial continues.</s>

The shootout caused panic and forced shops to closed their doors on Monday. Police say three men were killed and several arrested in the raid on the Pavao-Pavaozinho shantytown. Dramatic footage posted online shows one of the suspected criminals falling off a mountain after being shot by police. Pavao-Pavaozinho is built on the hills and granite mountains that divide the Copacabana, Ipanema and Lagoa neighbourhoods. Mr Beltrame led a controversial programme that saw the occupation of dozens of Rio's favelas by police. Residents initially welcomed the "pacification plan," and celebrated the arrest or escape of drug lords who controlled life in their communities. But many eventually turned against the programme after accusing police of abusing their powers. More than 260 favelas have been occupied since the programme was launched in 2010. Rio's pacification programme was aimed at improving security and the rule of law in the run-up to Brazil's hosting of the football World Cup in 2014 and Rio's staging of the Olympics and Paralympics, which took place in August and September.

The Synod - a defining moment for Pope Francis Almost 300 Church leaders - and some lay people - will be discussing such issues as the treatment of Catholics who are gay, and how to approach couples who live together without being married or wish to take communion after being divorced. Analysis: Caroline Wyatt, BBC News It is the most highly-anticipated meeting of the leaders of the Roman Catholic church since the Second Vatican council, some 50 years ago. In his homily today, the Pope spoke of the importance of the family - and perhaps rather pointedly, of the love between a man and a woman. He also said that the wealth of the developed world hadn't led to greater happiness, but to loneliness, and higher rates of abortion and divorce. Many campaigners and more liberal Catholics would like to see a change in Catholic doctrine on issues ranging from homosexuality to contraception. But while some bishops here do want reform, others remain fiercely opposed. In the end, though, the synod is not a democracy. It will be up to the Pope to decide what - if anything - changes, and how the Church applies its teaching to its sometimes errant flock. The Pope has called for a more understanding attitude on sexual issues. After his election in 2013, Pope Francis reaffirmed the</s>

Last August, the candidate gave a speech at a football stadium in Mobile, Alabama, that drew an estimated crowd of 30,000 - orders of magnitude above what any other Republican has tallied. It all makes for a rather unusual attraction, given that Southerners can look askance at brash Northerners like Trump, whom they often derisively refer to as Yankees.

For three years, Stephen Fearn, of the university's Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, has been teaching children from nearby schools to build bots. And with life-size, remote-control replicas of much-loved sci-fi characters R2-D2, K-9 and a Dalek in his garage, he's a good man for the job. "It's just inspirational with children," he said. "They are just like sponges, really. "They come with completely uninhibited imagination on the creative way then want to design and build their robots." Year 7 pupils from nearby Ysgol Penglais School and Ysgol Gyfun Gymunedol Penweddig School have joined the club in the past, with some previous members also staying on. They have contributed innovative, original and downright weird machines to its ragtag troupe of creations. "I learn every time," Mr Fearn said. "It's the shock factor - to see what these children come up with, as far as ideas and technology and how they are going to apply it to everyday life." Those involved learn how to solder, how to programme and how to use computer-aided design (CAD) to bring their electric dreams to life. Among the robots is Joseph, the humanoid with servos which operate his neck, eyes and knuckles - all made using a 3-D printouts from InMoov open-source designs. There's also Crawlerbot, a caterpillar track robot guided by infrared sensors and Granny Gadget, a converted mobility scooter operated using a tablet computer. Two of the club's members, Marley and Ferdia, won the best example of design award at the Young Rewired State Festival of Code 2015, a technology event for young people, with their ArduDuck creation.

That scoreline would have sent Everton to Wembley to face their arch-rivals. Sergio Aguero added a third goal that secured City's place in the final, but an inconsolable Martinez believed Everton's hopes had been wrecked in that crucial 70th-minute moment when referee Martin Atkinson and assistant Scott Ledger allowed play to continue. "You don't mind if Manchester City find a way of being outstanding and scoring three goals but it is very difficult to find an explanation in the dressing room for the players to find a reason we have been knocked out," he said. "That is hurtful and unfair." Martinez added: "It was a clear decision. The ball is out of play and the second goal affected the outcome too much. You feel so hurt because there have been a few big decisions that have not gone in our favour. "You have to respect the referees and they have the toughest job in football but certain decisions are clear cut, away from the judgment of the referee. "When the ball is out of play in the modern game, you don't expect that to be missed. When it ends up as the second goal, you can imagine the major blow it has to our feelings, our performance and our chances to get through." Martinez also dismissed talk of the introduction of technology when he said: "My question to the referees' chief is do we need technology or should we expect the linesman and the referee to get these calls right? For me that action is so clear. I would expect international or Premier League linesmen to get that call right. I would expect a top referee to get his angle and his position right." Martinez's complaints cut no ice with City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini, who pointed out that Everton had been the beneficiaries of refereeing decisions against his side recently. "</s>

INPUT: With the Women's Big Bash League over, Heather Knight reflects on another winter down under, pays tribute to one of her predecessors as England captain, is "put to shame by a 105-year-old", and looks ahead to a trip to Rwanda. We've played some brilliant cricket but have been a little bit inconsistent through the year. Saying that, we've managed to punch above our weight for a second year in a row and make it to the semi-finals, despite many predictions to the contrary. I've really enjoyed my time in the WBBL once again. It's definitely grown since last year with more publicity, more coverage and it's great to see some bigger crowds too. The double-headers with the men's Big Bash League are, I think, definitely the way forward until the competition grows enough to stand by itself - although it would be great to see the time gap between the end of the women's matches and the start of the men's games reduced, in order to get more people to come to both. The live online streaming of every WBBL match, outside of the TV broadcast fixtures, has been a very good addition, with highlights of every game available freely, and the social media presence has also been great. Unfortunately I got roped into embarrassing myself with my woeful singing, featuring in the Hurricanes' rendition of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" on the WBBL Pitch Perfect show with Aussie comedian Bobby.

INPUT: Dozens more bodies were retrieved from the ruined eight-storey Rana Plaza on Sunday. Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster has sparked nationwide anger. A preliminary government investigation said this week vibrations from four generators on the upper floors triggered the collapse. Main Uddin Khandaker, head of a government inquiry team, said the generators started up after a power cut, sending powerful vibrations throughout the building, which - together with the vibration of thousands of sewing machines - triggered the collapse. The building had been constructed with weak materials, such as sub-standard steel rods, Mr Khandaker added, which meant it could not withstand the vibrations. The architect of the building has said it was designed to house shops and offices rather than factories or industrial equipment, and that three floors had been illegally added to the original building. On Sunday evening, police working at the site of the collapse in Savar, outside the capital Dhaka, put the death toll at 610. But they would not say how many more bodies were likely to be recovered from the area.

INPUT: Drivers said a safety device, known as "a dead man's handle", failed to activate and stop their trams. Tram Operations Ltd, which runs the line, said driver fatigue was monitored and controls were "fully functional". An interim report into November's crash suggested the tram was speeding and the driver may have "lost awareness". It found there was no emergency braking and the tram had been travelling at 46mph before it crashed in a 13mph zone, near the Sandilands Junction area of Croydon. However, a BBC investigation for the Victoria Derbyshire programme, has found that at least three trams have been recorded speeding on that same line since the derailment. One was travelling at 40mph in a 25mph zone. Another is understood to have been speeding near the crash site. Four current and former drivers have also admitted they have fallen asleep while driving a tram. Konrad Turner, who retired last year after driving trams in Croydon for 16 years, said he woke up 10 metres after passing the line's George Street stop, adding: "A person was very fortunate that I didn't run them over." Mr Turner said his tram's driver safety device - which is used on different types of tram across the UK and Europe - failed to work. Drivers have to apply 1.5lb of pressure on a lever and push it forward for the tram to accelerate. If pressure is not maintained, a safety device inside the lever should activate - sounding an alarm and then applying an emergency brake. There is no suggestion a problem with this device was responsible for the derailment at Sandilands. Guidance from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) safety regulator says the driver safety device should activate "in the event of driver collapse". Further guidance also states the device should be designed "so that it cannot be kept in the operating position other than by a vigilant tram driver". But six drivers said the device was not "fit for purpose". One said drivers were afraid to tell management about safety device failures because they feared being sacked over falling asleep. "You're asking somebody to come forward and admit to something that could cost them their job," he said, adding that he believed most drivers had fallen asleep at some point in the career. The BBC has uncovered three incidents in the past decade where drivers were incapacitated.</s>

INPUT: The Washington Post says it obtained a 1991 phone conversation between a PR man calling himself John Miller, but sounding like Mr Trump, and a reporter. Mr Trump said the voice on the tape did not belong to him. Reporters who covered his early career say they regularly spoke to a Trump spokesman sounding exactly like him. They would hear from the "spokesman", named as John Miller or John Baron, when asking to interview Mr Trump. Mr Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee after pushing out more than a dozen Republican rivals in the race for the White House. Traditional Republicans are warming to him to unify the party and beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Reacting to the Washington Post story on Friday, Mr Trump made his denial on the Today Show. "No, I don't know anything about it," he said. "You're telling me about it for the first time and it doesn't sound like my voice at all." "I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn't sound like me. "It was not me on the phone. And it doesn't sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone." Donald Trump is an unusual man who often behaves, shall we say, unconventionally. There's plenty of evidence for this, whether or not he made calls 25 years ago pretending to be his own publicist. Many New York reporters are convinced that this is a bona fide recording of the billionaire, and the fact that he's (allegedly) boasting about his dating prowess and celebrity socialising probably isn't the kind of story Mr Trump wants circulating as he tries to present himself as a more serious general election candidate. This is just the start, however. While Mr Trump has been in the public eye for decades, and New York tabloid scrutiny can be daunting, nothing compares to the glare of the presidential spotlight. Given that this is Mr Trump's first foray into public office, his past will receive extra scrutiny - with more revelations to come.

INPUT: Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics. More specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy. The headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: "Consumption, great and small". What does this mean? Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households. Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time. The "great and small" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household. One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy. This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found. A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis. Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, "has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation". Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys. To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition. His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid. In addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers</s>

INPUT: He was re-elected for a second term by the UN General Assembly, unopposed and unanimously, on 21 June 2011, with effect from 1 January 2012. Mr Ban describes his priorities as mobilising world leaders to deal with climate change, economic upheaval, pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water. In style, he prefers quiet diplomacy and sees himself as a bridge-builder, aiming to give voice to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthen the UN itself, which was dented when he took office by scandals over the UN oil-for-food programme in Iraq, and corrupt procurement. The South Korean diplomat took over from Kofi Annan at the UN in 2007. At that time he promised to push for peace in the Middle East and Sudan's Darfur region, and he prioritised climate change. The consensus on his first term was largely positive, despite the elusiveness of many of his goals. He wants to be remembered as the UN leader who presided over a global agreement on climate change. Born on 13 June 1944 in Chungju, Mr Ban served as South Korea's minister of foreign affairs and trade immediately before moving to the UN, at the culmination of a 37-year career as a diplomat. That career included the tough, high-wire act of negotiations with North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons. He is married with three children and three grandchildren. In the past, UN leaders have normally served two terms, although Egypt's Boutros Boutros-Ghali was ousted after just one term in 1996 by the United States, which felt he had performed poorly over the Balkan wars. Mr Ban is the second Asian to lead the UN. He has enjoyed broad support, but he has his critics, who point to his low-key style, lack of charisma, and failure to criticise human rights abuses in powerful countries, like China and Russia. At the end of his first term, however, he won praise for his commitment to climate change, nuclear disarmament and women's issues, as well as his strong backing of pro-democracy movements in North Africa and the Middle East.

It has been credited with encouraging Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their own customers speed boosts without higher prices. However, Fiber's roll-out involved Google buying infrastructure built by companies that had collapsed as well as laying its own fibre optic cables - giving it full control of the service. By contrast, one expert said running a mobile virtual network - which is dependent on rivals' equipment - might limit Project Fi's impact.

"But the past isn't always a guide to the future. "No-one would have thought that a handset manufacturer could transform the mobile industry by teaming up with one network - but that's what happened with Apple and AT&T when the iPhone launched.

Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States. But here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday. In contrast, Transfer Deadline Days involve an awful lot of acquisitions across an unlevel playing field that often change nothing, but still generate enough hot air to make it seem as if they might.

INPUT: The big difference is that the numbers from which you make your six selections will go up in October from one to 49 to one to 59. While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of £1m and £20,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either £1m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to £2 but introduced the raffle with £20,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from £10 to £25. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because £2 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from £100,000 to £50,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from £1,500 to £1,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect. Because honestly, who can cope in their head with the difference between odds of 14 million to one and odds of 45 million to one? It's like comparing the odds of flipping a coin and getting 22 consecutive heads with the odds of getting 24. They both represent staggeringly unlikely events - it's just that in</s>

The Scot leaves behind a team marooned near the foot of La Liga, and a limp performance in Friday night's 2-0 defeat against lowly Las Palmas was the final straw. The dismal display, as much as the result, forced club president Jokin Aperribay into holding crisis talks over the weekend.

The official announcement was supposed to have been made on Sunday evening, but it was delayed for a few hours because Moyes's flight back to Bilbao from Manchester was cancelled. But once he returned to Spain on Monday and met personally with Aperribay, there was no need to delay the inevitable any longer and the former Everton and Manchester United coach's spell in La Liga was brought to a swift end. After La Real's recent struggles, the trip to Las Palmas was always billed as a significant encounter for Moyes's regime, but the general feeling was that his job was safe unless his team delivered a disastrous display. Unfortunately for the former Everton and Manchester United boss, 'disastrous' is pretty much the right word to describe the way his team performed - or didn't - against a Las Palmas outfit which had previously only won one game all season.

Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy. Mr Reid added: "They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods. "You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across."

The Local Development Plan (LDP) sets out where new houses can be built, based on a forecast that the population will grow by a quarter over 20 years. Cardiff council said the city was in "dire need" of the plan, to help it manage its growth. A final decision will be made by the local authority in the coming weeks, but it is expected to be rubber stamped by the council. Under the plan: The inspector has not given as much protection to the greenbelt on the edge of the city as a number of councillors and residents had campaigned for. The process has been long and controversial. Supporters say the expansion is needed to deal with the shortage of housing in the city, while opponents claim the city's infrastructure will not be able to cope. The plan is based on projections of a growth in the population from the 320,000 to nearly 400,000 over the period between 2006 and 2026. The last time Cardiff grew at this scale was at the height of the coal industry a century ago. Cardiff council cabinet member for planning and sustainability Ramesh Patel said the city was "in dire need" of the plan. "The last plan was approved 19 years ago and has led to insufficient land being made available for urgent housing needs," he said. "When the new plan is finally adopted at the end of January, we will ensure that developments in the city are managed effectively with new transport infrastructure, schools, health facilities and other community facilities.

The pictures of the spot reveal the intricate nature of its swirls which encompass a region bigger than Earth. Juno's instruments all acquired data during the pass which should now provide fresh insight on the storm. It has been a particularly long-lived feature on Jupiter, but there is evidence that the 16,350-km-wide oval has actually been shrinking of late. "For hundreds of years scientists have been observing, wondering and theorising about Jupiter's Great Red Spot," Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a Nasa statement. "Now we have the best pictures ever of this iconic storm. It will take us some time to analyse all the data from not only JunoCam, but Juno’s eight science instruments, to shed some new light on the past, present and future of the Great Red Spot." Scientists describe the storm as something similar to a hurricane - but there are significant differences between that kind of storm on Earth and what we see at Jupiter. Many behaviours are not the same. For example, hurricanes on Earth quickly lose energy when they leave the ocean surface and pass over land - but on Jupiter, there is no land. Indeed, researchers are not even sure there exists any kind of hard surface under the planet's clouds. This could be an explanation for why the spot has persisted for centuries. But Juno hopes to resolve such puzzles. It has the instrumentation to determine the precise chemical composition of the oval's clouds, to sense their temperature and structure, and to measure how deep they go. There is a suspicion that the spot has very deep roots. Jonathan Nichols, a British science team-member from the University of Leicester, marvelled at the new pictures. "These images are stunning, and reveal Jupiter's Great Red Spot in all its glory," he told BBC News. "From the three swirls inside the deep red core to the waves and vortices orbiting it, the images reveal the power and chaos of this iconic storm. "The light and dark shades reveal the wind flow in the spot and potentially the 3D structure of the cloud decks. But the images are also a perfect convergence of science and art, revealing the awesome beauty of</s>

In Saigon he trained and mentored young Vietnamese photographers who captured many of the war's defining images. Faas was injured in 1967 and later used a wheelchair for many years. He died after suffering years of health problems, including paralysis from the waist down. "Horst Faas was a giant in the world of photojournalism whose extraordinary commitment to telling difficult stories was unique and remarkable," said Santiago Lyon, AP's global head of photography. "He was an exceptional talent both behind the camera and editing the work of others and even in the grimmest circumstances he always made sure to live life to the fullest," Lyon said. "He will be sorely missed by scores of colleagues, especially that reduced group with whom he covered conflict, particularly the Vietnam generation." Speaking to the BBC in 2007, Faas described his job in simple terms. "I tried to be in the newspapers every day, to beat the opposition with better photos. I didn't try to do anything grandiose. The photos were used and published and asked for, becuase Vietnam was on the front pages year after year after. "I lived from day to day, from event to event. It was a perfect story for an agency photographer." He began his career covering conflicts in 1960, four years after joining the Associated Press (AP). He worked in what was then Zaire, and in Algeria, before relocating to Vietnam, where he won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Accepting the award, he said he aimed to "record the suffering, the emotions and the sacrifices of both Americans and Vietnamese in... this little bloodstained country so far away," AP said. He had a front row view of much of that suffering. When not in the midst of the conflict, Faas worked at AP's Saigon base, viewing and selecting images from his photographers to transmit on the wire to the rest of the world. Under his direction, AP photographers captured images that quickly became synonymous with the long war: among the most notable were Eddie Adams' image of the execution of a Viet Cong suspect and Nick Ut</s>

West Brom forward McClean had featured in the Republic's friendly defeat by Iceland just 24 hours earlier. "My wee boy, Adam, would be a big fan of his. James walked in and Adam was standing at the edge of the pitch," Mr Morrison said. "He pointed at him, then he pointed again and then the jaw opened.

INPUT: Gerard Coyne, who is challenging Len McCluskey for the leadership of Unite, said his rival was "seeing plots all over the place". He said Unite should not be focusing on "the extreme politics of the left". Mr McCluskey claims a "cabal" of MPs are treating the leadership contest as a "proxy war" against Mr Corbyn. But speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Coyne, the union's West Midlands secretary, said: "Len is seeing plots all over the place and actually it is only him that has lost the plot in this election. "He is rattled, he can see it slipping away from him, and he is lashing out with allegations about involvement in this campaign." The battle for control of Unite, Labour's biggest donor, has become increasingly bitter, with insults and accusations traded between Mr McCluskey and Mr Coyne. Fujitsu rep Ian Allinson completes the three-way line-up, and voting ends on 19 April. Mr McCluskey is a key ally of Mr Corbyn, and has suggested the Labour leader should be given 15 months to turn around his party's performance in the polls. Mr Coyne said he would offer no such "shelf life", but added that he had not supported Mr Corbyn's bid for the leadership, saying: "I would prefer the Labour Party to be able to form the next government." On Sunday Mr McCluskey told the Observer Mr Coyne's campaign was being "run by a cabal of West Midlands MPs who are trying to abuse Unite's democracy by fighting a proxy war against Corbyn". He has also labelled his rival a "puppet" for the media and the "right wing of the Labour Party".

INPUT: The case - which has seen the faces of the judges involved splashed across newspaper front pages - began its proceedings through the Supreme Court on Monday. There, the UK government will appeal against the ruling of the High Court, which said MPs should be able to vote on the starting-whistle to leave the European Union. They will be joined by a number of other parties which are intervening, including the Scottish and Welsh governments. In a nutshell, it is over whether ministers can use executive powers to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs. Ministers hold what are known as royal prerogative powers which allow them to take decisions without Parliament's approval. The case brought by claimants - the investment manager Gina Miller and hairdresser Dier Dos Santos - was that the government cannot use these powers to override rights enshrined in acts of Parliament. High Court judges agreed, but the UK government rejects this argument and has appealed to the Supreme Court. The BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman explains the case in more detail here. The Welsh Government has been allowed to intervene in the case, arguing that triggering Article 50 would "significantly change" how devolution works. Permission to intervene means ministers will have their case heard in front of Supreme Court judges. Counsel General Mick Antoniw argues that triggering Article 50 changes the powers of the assembly and the Welsh Government, and that this cannot be done without a vote in Parliament. The Welsh Government claims a large number of its functions come from EU law and will "be lost upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU Treaties". Separately, the counsel general's case sets out that triggering Article 50 will effectively circumvent the Sewel Convention, a set of rules that mean any attempt to change a law in a devolved area of policy needs the consent of AMs. Mr Antoniw does not ask state that the assembly has a legally enforceable right to veto any Westminster legislation authorising Article 50 to be triggered, but said instead that using executive powers to start the process would "short-circuit" the convention. The UK government's skeleton argument has rejected the counsel general's view, saying the additional issues raised "do not provide any tenable basis" on which to uphold the</s>

INPUT: Ms Perry told MPs she was "mystery shopping" the 10 busiest rail services in the country to find out for herself the extent of overcrowding. It was "unacceptable" that people were unable to board trains on commuter routes because they were already full. Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said his constituents expected answers about why they were been treated like "sardines". Mr Raab, the MP for Esher, raised conditions on the 07:32 Woking to London Waterloo service during a Westminster Hall debate on value for money on services operated by South West Trains. He said the train, dubbed the "Sardine Express" in the media, was regularly carrying 500 passengers more than its capacity and was "packed to the gunnels" long before it reached its final destination. Mr Raab said passengers were seeing their fares rising every year while having to put up with "cattle-class" travelling conditions. "EU rules stipulate that calves, adult goats and unshorn sheep must be transported by train in an area of space of at least 0.3 metres squared per unit of livestock," he said. "But the new governing standard for commissioning commuter services for humans is now 0.25 metres squared, significantly less." While demand for rail services was particularly acute in the south of England, Mr Raab said such overcrowding was not limited to the area but "systemic" across the network. Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage said overcrowding was not the only problem in the south of England and that journey times on busy routes were unsatisfactory. She said it took as long to travel from Portsmouth to London as it did from Doncaster to London, which is more twice the distance away from the capital. Ms Perry said the railways were a victim of their own popularity, with passenger numbers doubling since privatisation and demand increasing by 10% each year in some parts of the country. While the railways were the "safest and most punctual in Europe" and the government was investing billions in new lines and capacity, she acknowledged that conditions were not improving for some users. "Passengers in many cases do not feel they are getting value for money," she said. "They are travelling on crowded, slow trains and cannot understand why timetables get messed up and the whole</s>

"This extension will allow the court sufficient time to evaluate Mr Armstrong's amended complaint," read a statement from Tim Herman, counsel to Armstrong. The 40-year-old's initial 80-page complaint was thrown out on Monday, but he has submitted a shorter, 25-page suit asking a federal judge in Austin to prevent the case from going forward. Three of the six men named in the doping conspiracy case were given lifetime bans on Tuesday. Doctors Luis Garcia del Moral and Michele Ferrari, plus trainer Jose "Pepe" Marti, from the rider's US Postal Service team failed to answer charges before the USADA's deadline and were promptly banned. Armstrong's latest lawsuit argues: US District Judge Sam Sparks said the original lawsuit seemed more of an attempt to win over public opinion than to focus on legal argument. "This court is not inclined to indulge Armstrong's desire for publicity... by sifting through 80 mostly unnecessary pages [for] factual material relevant to his claims," Sparks wrote on Monday. USADA charged Armstrong with doping last month and claimed 10 of his former team-mates will testify against him. Armstrong, who dominated the Tour de France between 1999 and 2005, has never tested positive and says he has taken more than 500 drug tests in his career. In his original submission, he accused USADA, its chief executive Travis Tygart and FBI agent Jeff Novitzky of waging a personal vendetta. Armstrong has already urged USADA's review board to dismiss allegations brought against him, claiming they are "stale allegations disproved long ago and short on evidence". His legal team argue their client is unable to mount a legitimate defence until he is able to see the evidence against him, although USADA has said it is withholding witnesses' identities to protect them from intimidation.

INPUT: The case - which has seen the faces of the judges involved splashed across newspaper front pages - began its proceedings through the Supreme Court on Monday. There, the UK government will appeal against the ruling of the High Court, which said MPs should be able to vote on the starting-whistle to leave the European Union. They will be joined by a number of other parties which are intervening, including the Scottish and Welsh governments. In a nutshell, it is over whether ministers can use executive powers to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs. Ministers hold what are known as royal prerogative powers which allow them to take decisions without Parliament's approval. The case brought by claimants - the investment manager Gina Miller and hairdresser Dier Dos Santos - was that the government cannot use these powers to override rights enshrined in acts of Parliament. High Court judges agreed, but the UK government rejects this argument and has appealed to the Supreme Court. The BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman explains the case in more detail here. The Welsh Government has been allowed to intervene in the case, arguing that triggering Article 50 would "significantly change" how devolution works. Permission to intervene means ministers will have their case heard in front of Supreme Court judges. Counsel General Mick Antoniw argues that triggering Article 50 changes the powers of the assembly and the Welsh Government, and that this cannot be done without a vote in Parliament. The Welsh Government claims a large number of its functions come from EU law and will "be lost upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU Treaties". Separately, the counsel general's case sets out that triggering Article 50 will effectively circumvent the Sewel Convention, a set of rules that mean any attempt to change a law in a devolved area of policy needs the consent of AMs. Mr Antoniw does not ask state that the assembly has a legally enforceable right to veto any Westminster legislation authorising Article 50 to be triggered, but said instead that using executive powers to start the process would "short-circuit" the convention. The UK government's skeleton argument has rejected the counsel general's view, saying the additional issues raised "do not provide any tenable basis" on which to uphold the</s>

INPUT: Ms Perry told MPs she was "mystery shopping" the 10 busiest rail services in the country to find out for herself the extent of overcrowding. It was "unacceptable" that people were unable to board trains on commuter routes because they were already full. Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said his constituents expected answers about why they were been treated like "sardines". Mr Raab, the MP for Esher, raised conditions on the 07:32 Woking to London Waterloo service during a Westminster Hall debate on value for money on services operated by South West Trains. He said the train, dubbed the "Sardine Express" in the media, was regularly carrying 500 passengers more than its capacity and was "packed to the gunnels" long before it reached its final destination. Mr Raab said passengers were seeing their fares rising every year while having to put up with "cattle-class" travelling conditions. "EU rules stipulate that calves, adult goats and unshorn sheep must be transported by train in an area of space of at least 0.3 metres squared per unit of livestock," he said. "But the new governing standard for commissioning commuter services for humans is now 0.25 metres squared, significantly less." While demand for rail services was particularly acute in the south of England, Mr Raab said such overcrowding was not limited to the area but "systemic" across the network. Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage said overcrowding was not the only problem in the south of England and that journey times on busy routes were unsatisfactory. She said it took as long to travel from Portsmouth to London as it did from Doncaster to London, which is more twice the distance away from the capital. Ms Perry said the railways were a victim of their own popularity, with passenger numbers doubling since privatisation and demand increasing by 10% each year in some parts of the country. While the railways were the "safest and most punctual in Europe" and the government was investing billions in new lines and capacity, she acknowledged that conditions were not improving for some users. "Passengers in many cases do not feel they are getting value for money," she said. "They are travelling on crowded, slow trains and cannot understand why timetables get messed up and the whole</s>

North Lanarkshire Council Leader Jim Logue said: "I have made it clear since becoming council leader that we will settle equal pay claims where these are justified.

However, that deadline has now been extended by 30 days. Armstrong, who could lose his Tour titles and faces a lifetime ban, denies the charges. "This extension will allow the court sufficient time to evaluate Mr Armstrong's amended complaint," read a statement from Tim Herman, counsel to Armstrong. The 40-year-old's initial 80-page complaint was thrown out on Monday, but he has submitted a shorter, 25-page suit asking a federal judge in Austin to prevent the case from going forward. Three of the six men named in the doping conspiracy case were given lifetime bans on Tuesday. Doctors Luis Garcia del Moral and Michele Ferrari, plus trainer Jose "Pepe" Marti, from the rider's US Postal Service team failed to answer charges before the USADA's deadline and were promptly banned. Armstrong's latest lawsuit argues: US District Judge Sam Sparks said the original lawsuit seemed more of an attempt to win over public opinion than to focus on legal argument. "This court is not inclined to indulge Armstrong's desire for publicity... by sifting through 80 mostly unnecessary pages [for] factual material relevant to his claims," Sparks wrote on Monday. USADA charged Armstrong with doping last month and claimed 10 of his former team-mates will testify against him. Armstrong, who dominated the Tour de France between 1999 and 2005, has never tested positive and says he has taken more than 500 drug tests in his career. In his original submission, he accused USADA, its chief executive Travis Tygart and FBI agent Jeff Novitzky of waging a personal vendetta. Armstrong has already urged USADA's review board to dismiss allegations brought against him, claiming they are "stale allegations disproved long ago and short on evidence". His legal team argue their client is unable to mount a legitimate defence until he is able to see the evidence against him, although USADA has said it is withholding witnesses' identities to protect them from intimidation. Armstrong, who survived testicular cancer prior to his record-breaking Tour wins, retired after the 2005 race, but made a comeback in 2009.

INPUT: Lt Gen HR McMaster told ABC News there was consensus with China that this was a situation that "could not continue". The comments come after a failed missile test launch by North Korea and a massive military parade. President Trump had earlier said China was "working with us" on the issue. Beijing, Pyongyang's biggest ally, has come under pressure from Washington to exert more pressure on its neighbour. Sunday's comments appear to be the first confirmation that both countries are working together on how to deal with the North Korean issue. Gen McMaster, who was in the Afghan capital, Kabul, said the latest launch "fits a pattern of provocative and destabilising and threatening behaviour". "The president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons," he said. "I think there's an international consensus now, including the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just can't continue." President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed North Korea during a meeting last week. Mr Xi offered co-operation on "communication and co-ordination", the BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai reports. Earlier on Sunday, South Korean and US military officials said a North Korean missile had detonated soon after launch. The US Pacific Command said it believed it to be a ballistic missile. Investigations were continuing, but one unnamed US official said it was unlikely to have been an intercontinental (ICBM) missile. Ballistic missiles follow high trajectories and are initially powered and guided, but fall to their target under gravity. ICBMs follow a sub-orbital trajectory, others stay within the atmosphere. North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM that can reach targets around the world. Pyongyang has claimed to have miniaturised nuclear warheads for use on missiles, though experts have cast doubt on that given the lack of evidence. The state has already conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in contravention of UN resolutions. It has suffered test failures in the past but they have not deterred its development programme. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence is on a 10-day</s>

INPUT: Defence barrister Stephen Vullo made the announcement to the jury at Southwark Crown Court in London. The entertainer denies four charges relating to alleged assaults on three teenage girls between 1971 and 1983. Mr Harris, 87, was released from prison on Friday and is now appearing in the dock in person, having appeared via a video link in the trial's first week. Kenneth Jeacle, Mr Harris's former tour manager, told the court via video link from Australia he had seen parents encourage their children to "perhaps sit on his knee or perhaps give him a kiss on the cheek". But he said that Mr Harris was never the "instigator" of such behaviour. Mr Jeacle, who worked with the defendant from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, said: "Mr Harris's attitude in these incidents was always that people would approach him. "He would then perhaps open his arms and embrace them but in, shall I say, a fraternal or brotherly style or manner." Mr Vullo asked him whether he had ever seen Harris act inappropriately with his fans, and Mr Jeacle replied: "Categorically, never. "Mr Harris was, in my presence, constantly respectful of children and parents alike." Mr Harris is accused of groping a 14-year-old girl during a music event at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1971. Two further charges relate to alleged indecent assaults on a teenager in 1978, during filming for ITV celebrity show Star Games. The fourth relates to a 13-year-old girl who claims he touched her breast after filming BBC children's TV programme Saturday Superstore in 1983. Second defence lawyer David Patience read to the jury statements from people who attended the events. They included those who denied seeing or hearing anybody upset or anything of concern taking place. One was from ex-EastEnders and Coronation Street actress Rula Lenska, who was at Star Games. She said: "I can say, hand on heart, I never witnessed anything untoward or suspicious." Another woman, who was five when she attended the It's a Knockout-style event in 1978, said the "incredibly sweet" Mr Harris sat down next to her on a bench and gave her a cartoon.

INPUT: In the case of Baldock Town, that job has this season fallen to injured defender Liam Kenna. But his updates from the dugout during their FA Cup preliminary qualifying round tie against North Greenford United came to abrupt halt when he was sent on as a substitute with 10 minutes remaining. And the absence of his tweets prompted him to post an apology on behalf of the club the following day, which quickly went viral. "The secretary used to do it, but he left at the end of last season and because I have a bad back I've been doing it," the 29-year-old told BBC Sport. "I tweet every chance, every goal, every yellow card, I do it constantly." Kenna, from Llanelli, has not played this season because of his injury, but after only two or three light training sessions he was named among the substitutes. "There was a 90% chance I wasn't going to get on, but the centre-half got injured with 10 minutes left and we'd already used the other two subs," Kenna continued. "When I went to see the linesman to get my studs checked, I still had my phone in my hand. He said 'you can't go on with that mate'." The South Midlands League Division One side were 3-1 ahead when Kenna joined the action and held on to win by the same scoreline, but his lack of recent game-time took a physical toll. "I only touched the ball two or three times. I couldn't get round the pitch and couldn't breathe afterwards," he said. Former England striker Kevin Phillips and ex-Arsenal midfielder Ian Allinson both played for the original Baldock Town, which eventually folded in 2001. The current club was formed two years later and are now tenants at Arlesey's Town's Armadillo Stadium five miles away, having previously ground shared with Hitchin and Stotfold. Their reward for beating North Greenford is a home tie against Thame United of the Southern League over the weekend of the 9-10 September. And the FA have offered to do Baldock's tweeting for them so Kenna can concentrate on playing. He is no stranger to glory after captaining former club Welwyn Garden City to a league and cup</s>

INPUT: Official figures have shown a total of 72.4% of red calls were reached within eight minutes in December. It follows a new year-long pilot to test changes to the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust's patient response. In November, nearly 71% of code red calls were responded to compared with the 65% target. The new pilot, implemented in October, measures the results of treatment and patients' overall experience in a bid to make sure they receive the most appropriate care. The Emergency Ambulance Services Committee, which oversees the compilation of the data, said Wales now has the most detailed information on ambulance performance across the UK. The new data, for October to December, showed that out of 69,686 patients taken to hospital or another destination by ambulance, the vast majority - 63,694 - went to A&E. Ambulance crew handed over 58.2% of cases to hospital staff within the target time of 15 minutes, yet 12,233 hours were lost due to delays. Since a new traffic light system for grading calls was introduced, call centre staff have been given more time to determine the nature of the emergency. Of the total number of emergency calls received in December, 1,927 (5.0%) were red - "immediately life threatening" - the figures showed. Of those, more than 90% of red calls received a response within 15 minutes, but seven responses took longer than 30 minutes to arrive. Amber calls, deemed serious but not life threatening, do not have a target time but 65% were responded to within 15 minutes and 23 seconds. Emergency response time figures for November cannot be compared to December's as revised changes where introduced on 11 November, meaning a 999 call is now upgraded to a red category if the patient deteriorates. Tracy Myhill, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said they were "committed to learning and improving from this pilot as we move forward". Deputy health minister Vaughan Gething said it was "encouraging" to see "continuing improvement". "The new clinical response model is helping to ensure people get the right care, in the right place, at the right time," he said. However, he called for improvements in Powys and Hywel Dda health boards' performances, as both failed to reach the 65% emergency response target. Welsh Liberal Democrats leader</s>

INPUT: After more than 1,000 years underground - and nearly three since its discovery - part of the Galloway Viking hoard is going on public display in Edinburgh. A collection of "international significance", it comprises more than 100 gold, silver and other items. There is understandable excitement at the National Museum of Scotland at being able to give a glimpse of its treasures to a wider audience. In future, it is planned, it will also go on show in Kirkcudbright - closer to the spot it was discovered. It was September 2014 when metal detectorist Derek McLennan made the discovery of a lifetime on land in Dumfries and Galloway. Buried at the beginning of the 10th Century, some of the artefacts date back to an even earlier period. The hoard brings together the richest collection of rare Viking-age objects ever found in Britain. "It is very exciting to finally have the hoard on display," said NMS senior curator Dr Martin Goldberg, "To see it all laid out together for the first time is a real eye-opener for me - just seeing how much there is." He said a small treasure vessel in particular had produced some remarkable finds. "It is amazing - it is only 10cm high and 10cm in diameter - but the amount of things that were packed into it that we can now put on display," he said. The range of items spread out across the glass cabinets on display is impressive - the bulk of it silver jewellery and ingots. A tiny, gold, bird-shaped pin is particularly eye-catching as well as a number of brooches - some of a kind never previously found in Scotland. The temporary display of the hoard - which runs until October - is aimed at helping to raise funds towards the nearly <unk> £2m required to "save it for the nation". That process has not been without controversy. Dumfries and Galloway Council had put in a bid to secure the hoard for a new art gallery being built in Kirkcudbright but that was ultimately unsuccessful, despite going to appeal.

INPUT: The Shakespeare Schools Festival - an initiative which inspires schoolchildren to perform abridged versions of the playwright's famous work. From small beginnings, the initiative has grown into the UK's largest youth drama festival. And as the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death is marked on 23 April, we take a look back at its inception. "It all started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989," co-founder Chris Grace explained. As S4C's co-founder and director of animation, he had already made a name for himself kickstarting the Welsh animation industry with SuperTed and Fireman Sam. But as eastern Europe opened up, he was inspired by innovative Soviet techniques which used models, drawings and oil on glass. "I knew there was a Soviet tradition of animation which was totally different to Disney and it opened my eyes to new ways of making content accessible," he said. "I saw that Shakespeare could be a bridge between east and west; between Soviet tradition and western tradition." Working in Moscow, he helped to create 12 half-hour abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays - not an easy task when trying to maintain the original dialogue - with each one costing £500,000 to make. It was a turbulent time, with production surviving two attempted presidential coups - against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 and Boris Yeltsin in 1993. On one occasion, filming had to be stopped as tanks rumbled by outside, shaking the studio. On another, the studio came under fire from rebels, with bullet holes peppering the walls. "It was very exciting on one level because it was a new Europe," he said. "But it was also fearful. You didn't know the price of bread let alone what the cost of production was. "Despite this, we established a really strong production and international friendship between Wales and Russia." The 12 films, known as S4C's Shakespeare: The Animated Tales, were created in Welsh and English. Initially launched at the Royal Academy in London and City Hall in Cardiff, they went on to be released in 70 countries and won three Emmy awards. By the late-1990s, the films had a "huge up-take" in schools, introducing pupils to Shakespeare "for the very first time". "Every</s>

INPUT: On-loan Sam Gallagher looked to have won it on his first start for Rovers, heading in Craig Conway's corner. But Naylor met Matty Palmer's left-wing corner to seal a dramatic point. Conway had put Rovers ahead in the first half with a 25-yard drive that flew in off the bar, but Burton levelled with Jackson Irvine's header. A first-ever meeting between the two sides saw Rovers teenage academy product Scott Wharton handed a debut and he made an important early intervention to deflect John Mousinho's header wide. But after Conway took a Danny Graham pass to rifle in the 12th goal of his Rovers career, Burton, who did not include new loan signing John Brayford in their squad, were level just before the break as Mousinho's right-wing cross was met by an unmarked Irvine. Rovers started the second half brightly, only for Hope Akpan to head over a Conway free-kick, before Albion were unlucky when Naylor's long range drive crashed against the crossbar. Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, nodded in at the near post to put Rovers back in front, but Naylor was not to be denied to heap more pressure on Coyle, whose side are bottom of the Championship and the only club in the division still without a league win. Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "Having got ourselves ahead twice in the game, we could have seen it out and got the three points we were worthy of. "We all know it can be a cruel game but, having said that, there were a lot of positives we can take from the game - not least the performance of young Scott Wharton at the back on his debut." Rovers striker Sam Gallagher: "I was on the highest high from scoring my goal and then gutted when they got the equaliser. "I felt we deserved more, but at least we showed more character than in our other three games and we are off the mark." Burton manager Nigel Clough: "As pleasing as it is to get an 88th-minute equaliser, we are disappointed not to have won the game. "We looked a real threat from set-plays and we deserved at least a point." Match ends</s>

INPUT: Geoffrey Sutcliffe admitted causing the death of Lucille Abraham, 92. When applying to renew his driving licence, a court heard, Sutcliffe said he met the "required eyesight standard" and did not need glasses to drive. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. Sutcliffe hit Ms Abraham, from Baildon, at the junction of Godwin Street and Kirkgate, in Bradford, last October. During an eye test the previous month, Prosecutor Michael Smith said, Sutcliffe told the optometrist he was not a driver. Had he done so, Mr Smith said, she would have said that his eyesight had failed the visual acuity test. "The defendant suffers from cataracts in both eyes and it seems that the medical opinion here is that he should not undergo an operation on his right eye because effectively that's the only eye that can see," said Mr Smith. Barrister Ken Green, for Sutcliffe, said he had been driving for over 60 years without any previous offending and his client intended never to drive again and had surrendered his licence. "He will never forget that day and I am sure he will never forgive himself for that error that he made," said Mr Green.

Wear and tear, as well as damage caused by a lack of maintenance in homes are also key reasons for claims being rejected, an insurers' group said. In contrast, 99% of motor insurance claims result in a payout. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has published the industry-wide figures for the first time, after analysis of claims made during 2013 and 2014. The success rate figures are based on 6.9 million claims handed by 19 insurers, including 4.3 million motor insurance claims, 1.8 million home insurance claims, and 800,000 travel insurance claims. The analysis showed that 79% of home insurance policyholders who made a claim were successful, receiving a typical payout of <unk> £2,520. Of those whose claims were turned down, some made claims that were valued below the policy excess and others had bought the wrong kind of cover. Many home insurance policies have add-ons that cover certain eventualities, but add extra complexity to renewals. Many were denied due to a failure to maintain their property. For example, roof damage caused by a storm that affects numerous homes in an area is likely to be successful.

Despite rates of Meticillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) falling in many countries, concerns about its spread remain. The bug is resistant to most antibiotics and while it is can be carried harmlessly on the skin it may lead to serious wound infections - particularly in people who are already unwell. Hospitals have used a varied combination of methods to tackle it, including: Scientists reviewed studies over the last decade. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good. Prof Gerd Fatkenheuer, from the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, who was part of the research team said: "In the haste to do something against the rising tide of MRSA infection, measures were adopted that seemed plausible but were not properly assessed, bundling the effective and harmless with the ineffective and harmful. "We know for example that isolating patients can result in anxiety and depression and fewer visits by doctors and nurses." The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. Prof Peter Collignon at the Canberra Hospital, Australia said: "Certain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. "So we need to make sure that studies clearly show that we will not do harm by stopping some or all of these isolation methods." The report authors say as MRSA levels continue to drop this provides a good opportunity to reassess how best to tackle the problem. And they recommend scarce resources could be redeployed to combat other infections - rather than singling out MRSA. Recent figures for England suggest 862 cases of MRSA were recorded in the year 2013-14, a substantial reduction from the 4,451 cases reported in 2007-08.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>

INPUT: Cornell, 52, was found dead after performing in a concert with his band, Soundgarden, in Detroit on Wednesday evening. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed in a statement the frontman took his own life. In an earlier statement, Cornell's representative Brian Bumbery had said his death was "sudden and unexpected". It also said the family would be working closely with the medical examiner and asked for privacy. A spokesperson for Detroit Police confirmed to the BBC they received a call just after midnight (05:00 BST) on Wednesday. "He was found on the bathroom floor, our medical unit were called and he was pronounced dead on scene," a spokesperson said. "A family friend went to go check on him and observed him on the bathroom floor. The body was transferred to the medical examiner's office." The medical examiner's office said on Thursday that the cause of death had been determined as suicide by hanging, adding: "A full autopsy report has not yet been completed." The Soundgarden show was part of a wider tour and the group had a number of live dates scheduled for later this month. Sir Elton John led the tributes, tweeting: "Shocked and saddened by the sudden death of @chriscornell. A great singer, songwriter and the loveliest man." Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page added: "RIP Chris Cornell. Incredibly talented, incredibly young, incredibly missed." BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt said he was taken aback by Cornell's death. "This is a hell of a shock, he'd been gigging frequently despite having a life that was quite extreme, and he was certainly in extremely good health, performing concerts and seemingly pretty much at the top of his game," he said. Cornell was born on 20 July 1964. As a solo artist, he released four studio albums - most recently 2015's Higher Truth. His biggest single in the UK was 2006's You Know My Name, which was the theme song to Casino Royale, which starred Daniel Craig. The track made him the first male American artist to write and perform the theme song for a James Bond movie. But he was perhaps most famous as the lead singer of Seattle band Soundgarden, which formed in 1984 and went on to release six studio</s>

Cross-examining Mr Andrews, prosecutor Owen Edwards said to him: "You wanted sex whether she wanted it or not." The father-of-one replied: "No. that's not me." Mr Edwards then asked: "You got on top of her didn't you?" "No, there was no sex at all, of that I am certain. No sex that night, absolute fact," replied Mr Andrews. Mr Edwards said: "When she screamed you put your hand on her mouth and had sex with her. Is that rape?" "I would say so but that is not what happened. I did not rape her, that did not happen," replied Mr Andrews. "I have never put my hand on any female's mouth ever during sex. "Whatever she's describing, I never had sex with her. I never attempted to have sex with her. I have never forced myself on anyone, I would never do that." Since the start of the trial, the court has heard Mr Andrews described as "controlling, manipulative and bullying". The jury has been told the defendant held his hand over the woman's mouth while he raped her. They also heard accusations of him pursuing a campaign of stalking and harassment against another woman in the summer of 2013, during which he sent thousands of text messages and emails. Giving evidence in his defence on Thursday, the former detective broke down in court as he told the jury about his early police career. The court also heard how he was the force's most decorated officer and was described as "loyal and dedicated" by a former colleague. Mr Andrews also denies two counts of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and witness intimidation. The trial continues.</s>

The shootout caused panic and forced shops to closed their doors on Monday. Police say three men were killed and several arrested in the raid on the Pavao-Pavaozinho shantytown. Dramatic footage posted online shows one of the suspected criminals falling off a mountain after being shot by police. Pavao-Pavaozinho is built on the hills and granite mountains that divide the Copacabana, Ipanema and Lagoa neighbourhoods. Mr Beltrame led a controversial programme that saw the occupation of dozens of Rio's favelas by police. Residents initially welcomed the "pacification plan," and celebrated the arrest or escape of drug lords who controlled life in their communities. But many eventually turned against the programme after accusing police of abusing their powers. More than 260 favelas have been occupied since the programme was launched in 2010. Rio's pacification programme was aimed at improving security and the rule of law in the run-up to Brazil's hosting of the football World Cup in 2014 and Rio's staging of the Olympics and Paralympics, which took place in August and September.

He was later dismissed from his post at the Vatican's office in charge of guarding Roman Catholic doctrine. A Vatican spokesman said Monsignor Charamsa's decision to give interviews on the eve of the synod was "grave and irresponsible" and would put Pope Francis under "undue media pressure". In an interview with the Corriere Della Sera newspaper, the 43-year-old priest said: "It's time the Church opened its eyes and realised that offering gay believers total abstinence from a life of love is inhuman." The controversy has set the scene for what some fear could be a fractious three weeks, says BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt. The Synod - a defining moment for Pope Francis Almost 300 Church leaders - and some lay people - will be discussing such issues as the treatment of Catholics who are gay, and how to approach couples who live together without being married or wish to take communion after being divorced. Analysis: Caroline Wyatt, BBC News It is the most highly-anticipated meeting of the leaders of the Roman Catholic church since the Second Vatican council, some 50 years ago. In his homily today, the Pope spoke of the importance of the family - and perhaps rather pointedly, of the love between a man and a woman. He also said that the wealth of the developed world hadn't led to greater happiness, but to loneliness, and higher rates of abortion and divorce. Many campaigners and more liberal Catholics would like to see a change in Catholic doctrine on issues ranging from homosexuality to contraception. But while some bishops here do want reform, others remain fiercely opposed. In the end, though, the synod is not a democracy. It will be up to the Pope to decide what - if anything - changes, and how the Church applies its teaching to its sometimes errant flock. The Pope has called for a more understanding attitude on sexual issues. After his election in 2013, Pope Francis reaffirmed the</s>

In fact, across the South - in states like Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina - Mr Trump has been immensely popular. Last August, the candidate gave a speech at a football stadium in Mobile, Alabama, that drew an estimated crowd of 30,000 - orders of magnitude above what any other Republican has tallied. It all makes for a rather unusual attraction, given that Southerners can look askance at brash Northerners like Trump, whom they often derisively refer to as Yankees.

"He tells you like it is, and it hits you right, square between the eyes." Goodson was one of a crowd of more than 6,000 cheering for Mr Trump that night, and the candidate basked in the adoration.

For three years, Stephen Fearn, of the university's Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, has been teaching children from nearby schools to build bots. And with life-size, remote-control replicas of much-loved sci-fi characters R2-D2, K-9 and a Dalek in his garage, he's a good man for the job. "It's just inspirational with children," he said. "They are just like sponges, really. "They come with completely uninhibited imagination on the creative way then want to design and build their robots." Year 7 pupils from nearby Ysgol Penglais School and Ysgol Gyfun Gymunedol Penweddig School have joined the club in the past, with some previous members also staying on. They have contributed innovative, original and downright weird machines to its ragtag troupe of creations. "I learn every time," Mr Fearn said. "It's the shock factor - to see what these children come up with, as far as ideas and technology and how they are going to apply it to everyday life." Those involved learn how to solder, how to programme and how to use computer-aided design (CAD) to bring their electric dreams to life.

Martinez, however, was upset that the match officials failed to spot Raheem Sterling had run the ball out of play before crossing for Kevin de Bruyne to score City's second with a thrilling game poised at 1-1. That scoreline would have sent Everton to Wembley to face their arch-rivals. Sergio Aguero added a third goal that secured City's place in the final, but an inconsolable Martinez believed Everton's hopes had been wrecked in that crucial 70th-minute moment when referee Martin Atkinson and assistant Scott Ledger allowed play to continue. "You don't mind if Manchester City find a way of being outstanding and scoring three goals but it is very difficult to find an explanation in the dressing room for the players to find a reason we have been knocked out," he said. "That is hurtful and unfair." Martinez added: "It was a clear decision. The ball is out of play and the second goal affected the outcome too much. You feel so hurt because there have been a few big decisions that have not gone in our favour. "You have to respect the referees and they have the toughest job in football but certain decisions are clear cut, away from the judgment of the referee. "When the ball is out of play in the modern game, you don't expect that to be missed. When it ends up as the second goal, you can imagine the major blow it has to our feelings, our performance and our chances to get through." Martinez also dismissed talk of the introduction of technology when he said: "My question to the referees' chief is do we need technology or should we expect the linesman and the referee to get these calls right? For me that action is so clear. I would expect international or Premier League linesmen to get that call right. I would expect a top referee to get his angle and his position right." Martinez's complaints cut no ice with City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini, who pointed out that Everton had been the beneficiaries of refereeing decisions against his side recently. "</s>

We've played some brilliant cricket but have been a little bit inconsistent through the year. Saying that, we've managed to punch above our weight for a second year in a row and make it to the semi-finals, despite many predictions to the contrary. I've really enjoyed my time in the WBBL once again. It's definitely grown since last year with more publicity, more coverage and it's great to see some bigger crowds too. The double-headers with the men's Big Bash League are, I think, definitely the way forward until the competition grows enough to stand by itself - although it would be great to see the time gap between the end of the women's matches and the start of the men's games reduced, in order to get more people to come to both. The live online streaming of every WBBL match, outside of the TV broadcast fixtures, has been a very good addition, with highlights of every game available freely, and the social media presence has also been great. Unfortunately I got roped into embarrassing myself with my woeful singing, featuring in the Hurricanes' rendition of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" on the WBBL Pitch Perfect show with Aussie comedian Bobby. Note: the costumes were to try to mask our dreadful voices! I think there is a lot that can be learned from the WBBL to take into the ECB's second season of the Kia Super League this summer.

INPUT: Dozens more bodies were retrieved from the ruined eight-storey Rana Plaza on Sunday. Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster has sparked nationwide anger. A preliminary government investigation said this week vibrations from four generators on the upper floors triggered the collapse. Main Uddin Khandaker, head of a government inquiry team, said the generators started up after a power cut, sending powerful vibrations throughout the building, which - together with the vibration of thousands of sewing machines - triggered the collapse. The building had been constructed with weak materials, such as sub-standard steel rods, Mr Khandaker added, which meant it could not withstand the vibrations. The architect of the building has said it was designed to house shops and offices rather than factories or industrial equipment, and that three floors had been illegally added to the original building. On Sunday evening, police working at the site of the collapse in Savar, outside the capital Dhaka, put the death toll at 610. But they would not say how many more bodies were likely to be recovered from the area. Profile: Rana Plaza owner Nine people have been arrested in connection with the collapse: the building's owner Mohammed Sohel Rana, his father Abdul Khalek, four owners of garment factories that operated inside the building, and three engineers. Factory workers have held daily protests demanding improved safety regulations and calling for tough punishments for those responsible for the disaster. But Bangladeshi Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said on Friday he did not think the collapse would have a "really serious" impact on the country's garment industry.

INPUT: Drivers said a safety device, known as "a dead man's handle", failed to activate and stop their trams. Tram Operations Ltd, which runs the line, said driver fatigue was monitored and controls were "fully functional". An interim report into November's crash suggested the tram was speeding and the driver may have "lost awareness". It found there was no emergency braking and the tram had been travelling at 46mph before it crashed in a 13mph zone, near the Sandilands Junction area of Croydon. However, a BBC investigation for the Victoria Derbyshire programme, has found that at least three trams have been recorded speeding on that same line since the derailment. One was travelling at 40mph in a 25mph zone. Another is understood to have been speeding near the crash site. Four current and former drivers have also admitted they have fallen asleep while driving a tram. Konrad Turner, who retired last year after driving trams in Croydon for 16 years, said he woke up 10 metres after passing the line's George Street stop, adding: "A person was very fortunate that I didn't run them over." Mr Turner said his tram's driver safety device - which is used on different types of tram across the UK and Europe - failed to work. Drivers have to apply 1.5lb of pressure on a lever and push it forward for the tram to accelerate. If pressure is not maintained, a safety device inside the lever should activate - sounding an alarm and then applying an emergency brake. There is no suggestion a problem with this device was responsible for the derailment at Sandilands. Guidance from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) safety regulator says the driver safety device should activate "in the event of driver collapse". Further guidance also states the device should be designed "so that it cannot be kept in the operating position other than by a vigilant tram driver". But six drivers said the device was not "fit for purpose". One said drivers were afraid to tell management about safety device failures because they feared being sacked over falling asleep. "You're asking somebody to come forward and admit to something that could cost them their job," he said, adding that he believed most drivers had fallen asleep at some point in the career. The BBC has uncovered three incidents in the past decade where drivers were incapacitated.</s>

INPUT: The Washington Post says it obtained a 1991 phone conversation between a PR man calling himself John Miller, but sounding like Mr Trump, and a reporter. Mr Trump said the voice on the tape did not belong to him. Reporters who covered his early career say they regularly spoke to a Trump spokesman sounding exactly like him. They would hear from the "spokesman", named as John Miller or John Baron, when asking to interview Mr Trump. Mr Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee after pushing out more than a dozen Republican rivals in the race for the White House. Traditional Republicans are warming to him to unify the party and beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Reacting to the Washington Post story on Friday, Mr Trump made his denial on the Today Show. "No, I don't know anything about it," he said. "You're telling me about it for the first time and it doesn't sound like my voice at all." "I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn't sound like me. "It was not me on the phone. And it doesn't sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone." Donald Trump is an unusual man who often behaves, shall we say, unconventionally. There's plenty of evidence for this, whether or not he made calls 25 years ago pretending to be his own publicist. Many New York reporters are convinced that this is a bona fide recording of the billionaire, and the fact that he's (allegedly) boasting about his dating prowess and celebrity socialising probably isn't the kind of story Mr Trump wants circulating as he tries to present himself as a more serious general election candidate. This is just the start, however. While Mr Trump has been in the public eye for decades, and New York tabloid scrutiny can be daunting, nothing compares to the glare of the presidential spotlight. Given that this is Mr Trump's first foray into public office, his past will receive extra scrutiny - with more revelations to come.

INPUT: Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics. More specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy. The headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: "Consumption, great and small". What does this mean? Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households. Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time. The "great and small" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household. One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy. This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found. A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis. Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, "has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation". Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys. To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition. His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid. In addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers</s>

Mr Ban describes his priorities as mobilising world leaders to deal with climate change, economic upheaval, pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water. In style, he prefers quiet diplomacy and sees himself as a bridge-builder, aiming to give voice to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthen the UN itself, which was dented when he took office by scandals over the UN oil-for-food programme in Iraq, and corrupt procurement. The South Korean diplomat took over from Kofi Annan at the UN in 2007. At that time he promised to push for peace in the Middle East and Sudan's Darfur region, and he prioritised climate change. The consensus on his first term was largely positive, despite the elusiveness of many of his goals. He wants to be remembered as the UN leader who presided over a global agreement on climate change. Born on 13 June 1944 in Chungju, Mr Ban served as South Korea's minister of foreign affairs and trade immediately before moving to the UN, at the culmination of a 37-year career as a diplomat. That career included the tough, high-wire act of negotiations with North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons. He is married with three children and three grandchildren. In the past, UN leaders have normally served two terms, although Egypt's Boutros Boutros-Ghali was ousted after just one term in 1996 by the United States, which felt he had performed poorly over the Balkan wars. Mr Ban is the second Asian to lead the UN. He has enjoyed broad support, but he has his critics, who point to his low-key style, lack of charisma, and failure to criticise human rights abuses in powerful countries, like China and Russia. At the end of his first term, however, he won praise for his commitment to climate change, nuclear disarmament and women's issues, as well as his strong backing of pro-democracy movements in North Africa and the Middle East.

Initially, Project Fi will only be offered to Nexus 6 handset owners. Google Fiber, the firm's "ultra-fast" broadband service, is already seen as a disruptive force in the US telecoms market. It has been credited with encouraging Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their own customers speed boosts without higher prices. However, Fiber's roll-out involved Google buying infrastructure built by companies that had collapsed as well as laying its own fibre optic cables - giving it full control of the service. By contrast, one expert said running a mobile virtual network - which is dependent on rivals' equipment - might limit Project Fi's impact. "The example of MVNOs in the US and elsewhere suggests that it's hard for their operators to dramatically change the industry because of their nature," said Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. "But the past isn't always a guide to the future. "No-one would have thought that a handset manufacturer could transform the mobile industry by teaming up with one network - but that's what happened with Apple and AT&T when the iPhone launched.

Yet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States. But here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday.

INPUT: Leaked documents show that Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007. He did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later. He says no rules were broken and his wife did not benefit financially. The offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir in 2015. The leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson was granted a general power of attorney over Wintris - which gave him the power to manage the company "without any limitation". Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney. Court records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies. Mr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris. He resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full. If foreign investors had been repaid, it may have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris. But Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret. Mr Gunnlaugsson's spokesman said his policies had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants. "The prime minister's wife's losses on these bonds issued by the failed banks will amount to hundreds of millions of Kronur and the scope for recoveries is extremely small." The spokesman said Ms Palsdottir had always declared the assets to the tax authorities and that under the parliamentary rules Mr Gunnlaugsson did not have to declare an interest in Wintris. He said that joint share certificates in Wintris had been issued because the prime minister and his wife had a joint bank account. This was pointed out to them when the documents were reviewed in 2009. "</s>

While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of £1m and £20,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either £1m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to £2 but introduced the raffle with £20,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from £10 to £25. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because £2 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from £100,000 to £50,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from £1,500 to £1,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect. Because honestly, who can cope in their head with the difference between odds of 14 million to one and odds of 45 million to one? It's like comparing the odds of flipping a coin and getting 22 consecutive heads with the odds of getting 24. They both represent staggeringly unlikely events - it's just that in</s>

This is how his 364 days in charge went. After three days of speculation, the news was finally confirmed with a brief statement from the Basque club on Monday afternoon. "Real Sociedad would like to thank David Moyes and [his assistant, also departing] Billy McKinlay for the professional conduct, commitment and dedication which they showed during their roles in the running of the first team," the club said. "At the same time, we would like to wish them all the best in their future ventures, both professional and personal." The Scot leaves behind a team marooned near the foot of La Liga, and a limp performance in Friday night's 2-0 defeat against lowly Las Palmas was the final straw. The dismal display, as much as the result, forced club president Jokin Aperribay into holding crisis talks over the weekend. Aperribay did not want to rush into a hasty decision on the back of one bad game, but even after the dust had settled a couple of days later he still felt that a change was necessary. The official announcement was supposed to have been made on Sunday evening, but it was delayed for a few hours because Moyes's flight back to Bilbao from Manchester was cancelled. But once he returned to Spain on Monday and met personally with Aperribay, there was no need to delay the inevitable any longer and the former Everton and Manchester United coach's spell in La Liga was brought to a swift end. After La Real's recent struggles, the trip to Las Palmas was always billed as a significant encounter for Moyes's regime, but the general feeling was that his job was safe unless his team delivered a disastrous display. Unfortunately for the former Everton and Manchester United boss, 'disastrous' is pretty much the right word to describe the way his team performed - or didn't - against a Las Palmas outfit which had previously only won one game all season.

The two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands. Neil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: "It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way. "There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland." The group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists. Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy. Mr Reid added: "They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods. "You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across."

"Horst Faas was a giant in the world of photojournalism whose extraordinary commitment to telling difficult stories was unique and remarkable," said Santiago Lyon, AP's global head of photography. "He was an exceptional talent both behind the camera and editing the work of others and even in the grimmest circumstances he always made sure to live life to the fullest," Lyon said. "He will be sorely missed by scores of colleagues, especially that reduced group with whom he covered conflict, particularly the Vietnam generation." Speaking to the BBC in 2007, Faas described his job in simple terms. "I tried to be in the newspapers every day, to beat the opposition with better photos. I didn't try to do anything grandiose. The photos were used and published and asked for, becuase Vietnam was on the front pages year after year after. "I lived from day to day, from event to event. It was a perfect story for an agency photographer." He began his career covering conflicts in 1960, four years after joining the Associated Press (AP). He worked in what was then Zaire, and in Algeria, before relocating to Vietnam, where he won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Accepting the award, he said he aimed to "record the suffering, the emotions and the sacrifices of both Americans and Vietnamese in... this little bloodstained country so far away," AP said. He had a front row view of much of that suffering. When not in the midst of the conflict, Faas worked at AP's Saigon base, viewing and selecting images from his photographers to transmit on the wire to the rest of the world.

A plea was put out on social media several weeks ago to try to find them some competitors. The team's manager then received a message from West Brom star McClean, which he thought was a "wind-up". "Out of the blue I get a message from the man himself, James McClean, on Facebook," Kevin Morrison said. "To be honest I thought it was one of those fake accounts, that somebody was taking the hand out of me. "He said: 'I'm playing a match on Tuesday night, I'll be back in Derry at lunchtime on Wednesday - how does that sound?'" Football strips and runners at the ready, it was still a surprise for Kevin Morrison's son when one of his idols joined them at the city's indoor football centre - and brought a few mates to make up a team. West Brom forward McClean had featured in the Republic's friendly defeat by Iceland just 24 hours earlier. "My wee boy, Adam, would be a big fan of his. James walked in and Adam was standing at the edge of the pitch," Mr Morrison said. "He pointed at him, then he pointed again and then the jaw opened.

INPUT: Lt Gen HR McMaster told ABC News there was consensus with China that this was a situation that "could not continue". The comments come after a failed missile test launch by North Korea and a massive military parade. President Trump had earlier said China was "working with us" on the issue. Beijing, Pyongyang's biggest ally, has come under pressure from Washington to exert more pressure on its neighbour. Sunday's comments appear to be the first confirmation that both countries are working together on how to deal with the North Korean issue. Gen McMaster, who was in the Afghan capital, Kabul, said the latest launch "fits a pattern of provocative and destabilising and threatening behaviour". "The president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons," he said. "I think there's an international consensus now, including the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just can't continue." President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed North Korea during a meeting last week. Mr Xi offered co-operation on "communication and co-ordination", the BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai reports. Earlier on Sunday, South Korean and US military officials said a North Korean missile had detonated soon after launch. The US Pacific Command said it believed it to be a ballistic missile. Investigations were continuing, but one unnamed US official said it was unlikely to have been an intercontinental (ICBM) missile. Ballistic missiles follow high trajectories and are initially powered and guided, but fall to their target under gravity. ICBMs follow a sub-orbital trajectory, others stay within the atmosphere. North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM that can reach targets around the world. Pyongyang has claimed to have miniaturised nuclear warheads for use on missiles, though experts have cast doubt on that given the lack of evidence. The state has already conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in contravention of UN resolutions. It has suffered test failures in the past but they have not deterred its development programme. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence is on a 10-day</s>

INPUT: Defence barrister Stephen Vullo made the announcement to the jury at Southwark Crown Court in London. The entertainer denies four charges relating to alleged assaults on three teenage girls between 1971 and 1983. Mr Harris, 87, was released from prison on Friday and is now appearing in the dock in person, having appeared via a video link in the trial's first week. Kenneth Jeacle, Mr Harris's former tour manager, told the court via video link from Australia he had seen parents encourage their children to "perhaps sit on his knee or perhaps give him a kiss on the cheek". But he said that Mr Harris was never the "instigator" of such behaviour. Mr Jeacle, who worked with the defendant from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, said: "Mr Harris's attitude in these incidents was always that people would approach him. "He would then perhaps open his arms and embrace them but in, shall I say, a fraternal or brotherly style or manner." Mr Vullo asked him whether he had ever seen Harris act inappropriately with his fans, and Mr Jeacle replied: "Categorically, never. "Mr Harris was, in my presence, constantly respectful of children and parents alike." Mr Harris is accused of groping a 14-year-old girl during a music event at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1971. Two further charges relate to alleged indecent assaults on a teenager in 1978, during filming for ITV celebrity show Star Games. The fourth relates to a 13-year-old girl who claims he touched her breast after filming BBC children's TV programme Saturday Superstore in 1983. Second defence lawyer David Patience read to the jury statements from people who attended the events. They included those who denied seeing or hearing anybody upset or anything of concern taking place. One was from ex-EastEnders and Coronation Street actress Rula Lenska, who was at Star Games. She said: "I can say, hand on heart, I never witnessed anything untoward or suspicious."

INPUT: In the case of Baldock Town, that job has this season fallen to injured defender Liam Kenna. But his updates from the dugout during their FA Cup preliminary qualifying round tie against North Greenford United came to abrupt halt when he was sent on as a substitute with 10 minutes remaining. And the absence of his tweets prompted him to post an apology on behalf of the club the following day, which quickly went viral. "The secretary used to do it, but he left at the end of last season and because I have a bad back I've been doing it," the 29-year-old told BBC Sport. "I tweet every chance, every goal, every yellow card, I do it constantly." Kenna, from Llanelli, has not played this season because of his injury, but after only two or three light training sessions he was named among the substitutes. "There was a 90% chance I wasn't going to get on, but the centre-half got injured with 10 minutes left and we'd already used the other two subs," Kenna continued. "When I went to see the linesman to get my studs checked, I still had my phone in my hand. He said 'you can't go on with that mate'." The South Midlands League Division One side were 3-1 ahead when Kenna joined the action and held on to win by the same scoreline, but his lack of recent game-time took a physical toll. "I only touched the ball two or three times. I couldn't get round the pitch and couldn't breathe afterwards," he said. Former England striker Kevin Phillips and ex-Arsenal midfielder Ian Allinson both played for the original Baldock Town, which eventually folded in 2001. The current club was formed two years later and are now tenants at Arlesey's Town's Armadillo Stadium five miles away, having previously ground shared with Hitchin and Stotfold. Their reward for beating North Greenford is a home tie against Thame United of the Southern League over the weekend of the 9-10 September. And the FA have offered to do Baldock's tweeting for them so Kenna can concentrate on playing. He is no stranger to glory after captaining former club Welwyn Garden City to a league and cup</s>

INPUT: Official figures have shown a total of 72.4% of red calls were reached within eight minutes in December. It follows a new year-long pilot to test changes to the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust's patient response. In November, nearly 71% of code red calls were responded to compared with the 65% target. The new pilot, implemented in October, measures the results of treatment and patients' overall experience in a bid to make sure they receive the most appropriate care. The Emergency Ambulance Services Committee, which oversees the compilation of the data, said Wales now has the most detailed information on ambulance performance across the UK. The new data, for October to December, showed that out of 69,686 patients taken to hospital or another destination by ambulance, the vast majority - 63,694 - went to A&E. Ambulance crew handed over 58.2% of cases to hospital staff within the target time of 15 minutes, yet 12,233 hours were lost due to delays. Since a new traffic light system for grading calls was introduced, call centre staff have been given more time to determine the nature of the emergency. Of the total number of emergency calls received in December, 1,927 (5.0%) were red - "immediately life threatening" - the figures showed. Of those, more than 90% of red calls received a response within 15 minutes, but seven responses took longer than 30 minutes to arrive. Amber calls, deemed serious but not life threatening, do not have a target time but 65% were responded to within 15 minutes and 23 seconds. Emergency response time figures for November cannot be compared to December's as revised changes where introduced on 11 November, meaning a 999 call is now upgraded to a red category if the patient deteriorates. Tracy Myhill, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said they were "committed to learning and improving from this pilot as we move forward". Deputy health minister Vaughan Gething said it was "encouraging" to see "continuing improvement". "The new clinical response model is helping to ensure people get the right care, in the right place, at the right time," he said.

INPUT: After more than 1,000 years underground - and nearly three since its discovery - part of the Galloway Viking hoard is going on public display in Edinburgh. A collection of "international significance", it comprises more than 100 gold, silver and other items. There is understandable excitement at the National Museum of Scotland at being able to give a glimpse of its treasures to a wider audience. In future, it is planned, it will also go on show in Kirkcudbright - closer to the spot it was discovered. It was September 2014 when metal detectorist Derek McLennan made the discovery of a lifetime on land in Dumfries and Galloway. Buried at the beginning of the 10th Century, some of the artefacts date back to an even earlier period. The hoard brings together the richest collection of rare Viking-age objects ever found in Britain. "It is very exciting to finally have the hoard on display," said NMS senior curator Dr Martin Goldberg, "To see it all laid out together for the first time is a real eye-opener for me - just seeing how much there is." He said a small treasure vessel in particular had produced some remarkable finds. "It is amazing - it is only 10cm high and 10cm in diameter - but the amount of things that were packed into it that we can now put on display," he said. The range of items spread out across the glass cabinets on display is impressive - the bulk of it silver jewellery and ingots. A tiny, gold, bird-shaped pin is particularly eye-catching as well as a number of brooches - some of a kind never previously found in Scotland. The temporary display of the hoard - which runs until October - is aimed at helping to raise funds towards the nearly <unk> £2m required to "save it for the nation". That process has not been without controversy. Dumfries and Galloway Council had put in a bid to secure the hoard for a new art gallery being built in Kirkcudbright but that was ultimately unsuccessful, despite going to appeal. NMS has pledged to put part of the collection on permanent display in the town in due course and, on occasions, let all the artefacts come to the region. Not everyone in Dumfries and Gall</s>

The 73-year-old was travelling at 70mph towards London when "chaos broke loose" and "bits were flying everywhere". "I moved to the outside lane. There was only one place to go. I threw the bike on the floor and went under," he said. Mr Shaw's bike was trapped under tonnes of concrete following the collapse. Part of the bridge also fell on to a second lorry, the driver of which was treated for shock at the scene. Speaking from his hospital bed in Tunbridge Wells, Mr Shaw said he had been "riding down the motorway, enjoying life as it goes by" on his bike when he was forced to take evasive action.

"There are issues surrounding the pressures of use.

"We celebrate the mountain - people do value it and enjoy their time here - so we are not interested in turning people away. "We are looking at the positives and putting the limited resources that the partner bodies have to get the best outcome." The partnership also wants to build on the success of tourism, saying about <unk> £69m is directly spent by visitors in local communities.

From small beginnings, the initiative has grown into the UK's largest youth drama festival. And as the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death is marked on 23 April, we take a look back at its inception. "It all started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989," co-founder Chris Grace explained. As S4C's co-founder and director of animation, he had already made a name for himself kickstarting the Welsh animation industry with SuperTed and Fireman Sam. But as eastern Europe opened up, he was inspired by innovative Soviet techniques which used models, drawings and oil on glass. "I knew there was a Soviet tradition of animation which was totally different to Disney and it opened my eyes to new ways of making content accessible," he said. "I saw that Shakespeare could be a bridge between east and west; between Soviet tradition and western tradition." Working in Moscow, he helped to create 12 half-hour abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays - not an easy task when trying to maintain the original dialogue - with each one costing £500,000 to make. It was a turbulent time, with production surviving two attempted presidential coups - against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 and Boris Yeltsin in 1993. On one occasion, filming had to be stopped as tanks rumbled by outside, shaking the studio. On another, the studio came under fire from rebels, with bullet holes peppering the walls. "It was very exciting on one level because it was a new Europe," he said. "But it was also fearful. You didn't know the price of bread let alone what the cost of production was. "Despite this, we established a really strong production and international friendship between Wales and Russia." The 12 films, known as S4C's Shakespeare: The Animated Tales, were created in Welsh and English. Initially launched at the Royal Academy in London and City Hall in Cardiff, they went on to be released in 70 countries and won three Emmy awards. By the late-1990s, the films had a "huge up-take" in schools, introducing pupils to Shakespeare "for the very first time". "Every</s>

INPUT: On-loan Sam Gallagher looked to have won it on his first start for Rovers, heading in Craig Conway's corner. But Naylor met Matty Palmer's left-wing corner to seal a dramatic point. Conway had put Rovers ahead in the first half with a 25-yard drive that flew in off the bar, but Burton levelled with Jackson Irvine's header. A first-ever meeting between the two sides saw Rovers teenage academy product Scott Wharton handed a debut and he made an important early intervention to deflect John Mousinho's header wide. But after Conway took a Danny Graham pass to rifle in the 12th goal of his Rovers career, Burton, who did not include new loan signing John Brayford in their squad, were level just before the break as Mousinho's right-wing cross was met by an unmarked Irvine. Rovers started the second half brightly, only for Hope Akpan to head over a Conway free-kick, before Albion were unlucky when Naylor's long range drive crashed against the crossbar. Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, nodded in at the near post to put Rovers back in front, but Naylor was not to be denied to heap more pressure on Coyle, whose side are bottom of the Championship and the only club in the division still without a league win. Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "Having got ourselves ahead twice in the game, we could have seen it out and got the three points we were worthy of. "We all know it can be a cruel game but, having said that, there were a lot of positives we can take from the game - not least the performance of young Scott Wharton at the back on his debut." Rovers striker Sam Gallagher: "I was on the highest high from scoring my goal and then gutted when they got the equaliser. "I felt we deserved more, but at least we showed more character than in our other three games and we are off the mark." Burton manager Nigel Clough: "As pleasing as it is to get an 88th-minute equaliser, we are disappointed not to have won the game. "We looked a real threat from set-plays and we deserved at least a point." Match ends</s>

INPUT: Confusion about what is covered by insurance policies is one of the reasons that policyholders fail to receive a payout. Wear and tear, as well as damage caused by a lack of maintenance in homes are also key reasons for claims being rejected, an insurers' group said. In contrast, 99% of motor insurance claims result in a payout. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has published the industry-wide figures for the first time, after analysis of claims made during 2013 and 2014. The success rate figures are based on 6.9 million claims handed by 19 insurers, including 4.3 million motor insurance claims, 1.8 million home insurance claims, and 800,000 travel insurance claims. The analysis showed that 79% of home insurance policyholders who made a claim were successful, receiving a typical payout of <unk> £2,520. Of those whose claims were turned down, some made claims that were valued below the policy excess and others had bought the wrong kind of cover. Many home insurance policies have add-ons that cover certain eventualities, but add extra complexity to renewals. Many were denied due to a failure to maintain their property. For example, roof damage caused by a storm that affects numerous homes in an area is likely to be successful. Roof damage caused because previous faults had been left without the homeowner's attention were less likely to succeed, the ABI said. Policies were designed to cover "sudden, unexpected and accidental" events, an ABI spokesman said. Travel insurance claims recorded a success rate of 87%, the ABI said, with an average payout of <unk> £884. Reasons for rejection include failure to declare a pre-existing medical condition and failure to prove that belongings have been lost. Motor insurance claims were successful in 99% of cases, with an average payout of <unk> £2,160. Cases and policies tended to be simpler, leading to fewer denied claims. Huw Evans, ABI director general, said that the figures were published in order to gain greater trust from consumers. "Contrary to popular belief, insurers want to pay honest claims. It helps nobody when customers have bought the wrong product or have not disclosed important information," he said. "So we will use the analysis we are publishing today to drive awareness campaigns to improve even further the acceptance rates for home and travel.

That is a dramatic turn-around since the last survey before the military and media campaigns began, when a majority were opposed. It is a reassuring result for Vladimir Putin, for whom the Syria campaign is another chance to play the strong man and reassert Russia on the global power map. The first cruise missiles modern Russia has ever launched in combat were fired on his 63rd birthday; the dramatic images were screened repeatedly, almost like celebratory fireworks. The next day's newspapers hailed the barrage as proof that Russia is back to rival the USA, after President Putin's massive investment in a military modernization drive. But the Levada centre survey revealed another important statistic. "There is a clear fear that Russia will get stuck in Syria, like the Soviet Union did in Afghanistan; that this will be a long campaign, with human sacrifice and great cost," the centre's director Lev Gudkov points out. That is despite repeat assurances that Russia will not deploy ground troops. "The Kremlin is underlining that this is a short-term operation, and only from the air.

Plaid originally planned a free vote and some of its AMs were expected to support the bill on Wednesday evening, although a greater number were in opposition. But the party's last minute decision to vote against it as a group meant the assembly was tied 26-26 and the legislation failed.

Despite rates of Meticillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) falling in many countries, concerns about its spread remain. The bug is resistant to most antibiotics and while it is can be carried harmlessly on the skin it may lead to serious wound infections - particularly in people who are already unwell. Hospitals have used a varied combination of methods to tackle it, including: Scientists reviewed studies over the last decade. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good. Prof Gerd Fatkenheuer, from the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, who was part of the research team said: "In the haste to do something against the rising tide of MRSA infection, measures were adopted that seemed plausible but were not properly assessed, bundling the effective and harmless with the ineffective and harmful. "We know for example that isolating patients can result in anxiety and depression and fewer visits by doctors and nurses." The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. Prof Peter Collignon at the Canberra Hospital, Australia said: "Certain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. "So we need to make sure that studies clearly show that we will not do harm by stopping some or all of these isolation methods." The report authors say as MRSA levels continue to drop this provides a good opportunity to reassess how best to tackle the problem.

"This is a hell of a shock, he'd been gigging frequently despite having a life that was quite extreme, and he was certainly in extremely good health, performing concerts and seemingly pretty much at the top of his game," he said. Cornell was born on 20 July 1964. As a solo artist, he released four studio albums - most recently 2015's Higher Truth. His biggest single in the UK was 2006's You Know My Name, which was the theme song to Casino Royale, which starred Daniel Craig.

Cross-examining Mr Andrews, prosecutor Owen Edwards said to him: "You wanted sex whether she wanted it or not." The father-of-one replied: "No. that's not me." Mr Edwards then asked: "You got on top of her didn't you?" "No, there was no sex at all, of that I am certain. No sex that night, absolute fact," replied Mr Andrews. Mr Edwards said: "When she screamed you put your hand on her mouth and had sex with her. Is that rape?" "I would say so but that is not what happened. I did not rape her, that did not happen," replied Mr Andrews. "I have never put my hand on any female's mouth ever during sex. "Whatever she's describing, I never had sex with her. I never attempted to have sex with her. I have never forced myself on anyone, I would never do that." Since the start of the trial, the court has heard Mr Andrews described as "controlling, manipulative and bullying". The jury has been told the defendant held his hand over the woman's mouth while he raped her.

The shootout caused panic and forced shops to closed their doors on Monday. Police say three men were killed and several arrested in the raid on the Pavao-Pavaozinho shantytown. Dramatic footage posted online shows one of the suspected criminals falling off a mountain after being shot by police. Pavao-Pavaozinho is built on the hills and granite mountains that divide the Copacabana, Ipanema and Lagoa neighbourhoods. Mr Beltrame led a controversial programme that saw the occupation of dozens of Rio's favelas by police. Residents initially welcomed the "pacification plan," and celebrated the arrest or escape of drug lords who controlled life in their communities. But many eventually turned against the programme after accusing police of abusing their powers. More than 260 favelas have been occupied since the programme was launched in 2010. Rio's pacification programme was aimed at improving security and the rule of law in the run-up to Brazil's hosting of the football World Cup in 2014 and Rio's staging of the Olympics and Paralympics, which took place in August and September.

Poland-born Krzysztof Charamsa said he wanted to challenge the Church's "backward" attitude to homosexuality. He was later dismissed from his post at the Vatican's office in charge of guarding Roman Catholic doctrine. A Vatican spokesman said Monsignor Charamsa's decision to give interviews on the eve of the synod was "grave and irresponsible" and would put Pope Francis under "undue media pressure". In an interview with the Corriere Della Sera newspaper, the 43-year-old priest said: "It's time the Church opened its eyes and realised that offering gay believers total abstinence from a life of love is inhuman." The controversy has set the scene for what some fear could be a fractious three weeks, says BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt. The Synod - a defining moment for Pope Francis Almost 300 Church leaders - and some lay people - will be discussing such issues as the treatment of Catholics who are gay, and how to approach couples who live together without being married or wish to take communion after being divorced. Analysis: Caroline Wyatt, BBC News It is the most highly-anticipated meeting of the leaders of the Roman Catholic church since the Second Vatican council, some 50 years ago. In his homily today, the Pope spoke of the importance of the family - and perhaps rather pointedly, of the love between a man and a woman. He also said that the wealth of the developed world hadn't led to greater happiness, but to loneliness, and higher rates of abortion and divorce. Many campaigners and more liberal Catholics would like to see a change in Catholic doctrine on issues ranging from homosexuality to contraception. But while some bishops here do want reform, others remain fiercely opposed. In the end, though, the synod is not a democracy. It will be up to the Pope to decide what - if anything - changes, and how the Church applies its teaching to its sometimes errant flock. The Pope has called for a more understanding attitude on sexual issues. After his election in 2013, Pope Francis reaffirmed the</s>

And with life-size, remote-control replicas of much-loved sci-fi characters R2-D2, K-9 and a Dalek in his garage, he's a good man for the job. "It's just inspirational with children," he said. "They are just like sponges, really. "They come with completely uninhibited imagination on the creative way then want to design and build their robots." Year 7 pupils from nearby Ysgol Penglais School and Ysgol Gyfun Gymunedol Penweddig School have joined the club in the past, with some previous members also staying on. They have contributed innovative, original and downright weird machines to its ragtag troupe of creations. "I learn every time," Mr Fearn said. "It's the shock factor - to see what these children come up with, as far as ideas and technology and how they are going to apply it to everyday life."

Martinez, however, was upset that the match officials failed to spot Raheem Sterling had run the ball out of play before crossing for Kevin de Bruyne to score City's second with a thrilling game poised at 1-1. That scoreline would have sent Everton to Wembley to face their arch-rivals. Sergio Aguero added a third goal that secured City's place in the final, but an inconsolable Martinez believed Everton's hopes had been wrecked in that crucial 70th-minute moment when referee Martin Atkinson and assistant Scott Ledger allowed play to continue. "You don't mind if Manchester City find a way of being outstanding and scoring three goals but it is very difficult to find an explanation in the dressing room for the players to find a reason we have been knocked out," he said. "That is hurtful and unfair." Martinez added: "It was a clear decision. The ball is out of play and the second goal affected the outcome too much. You feel so hurt because there have been a few big decisions that have not gone in our favour. "You have to respect the referees and they have the toughest job in football but certain decisions are clear cut, away from the judgment of the referee. "When the ball is out of play in the modern game, you don't expect that to be missed. When it ends up as the second goal, you can imagine the major blow it has to our feelings, our performance and our chances to get through." Martinez also dismissed talk of the introduction of technology when he said: "My question to the referees' chief is do we need technology or should we expect the linesman and the referee to get these calls right? For me that action is so clear. I would expect international or Premier League linesmen to get that call right. I would expect a top referee to get his angle and his position right." Martinez's complaints cut no ice with City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini, who pointed out that Everton had been the beneficiaries of refereeing decisions against his side recently. "</s>

We've played some brilliant cricket but have been a little bit inconsistent through the year. Saying that, we've managed to punch above our weight for a second year in a row and make it to the semi-finals, despite many predictions to the contrary. I've really enjoyed my time in the WBBL once again. It's definitely grown since last year with more publicity, more coverage and it's great to see some bigger crowds too. The double-headers with the men's Big Bash League are, I think, definitely the way forward until the competition grows enough to stand by itself - although it would be great to see the time gap between the end of the women's matches and the start of the men's games reduced, in order to get more people to come to both. The live online streaming of every WBBL match, outside of the TV broadcast fixtures, has been a very good addition, with highlights of every game available freely, and the social media presence has also been great. Unfortunately I got roped into embarrassing myself with my woeful singing, featuring in the Hurricanes' rendition of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" on the WBBL Pitch Perfect show with Aussie comedian Bobby. Note: the costumes were to try to mask our dreadful voices! I think there is a lot that can be learned from the WBBL to take into the ECB's second season of the Kia Super League this summer. Having two expanding domestic competitions in Australia and England will only help the global development of the women's game, so hopefully the Super League will bounce off the back of the second WBBL, and of course the ICC Women's World Cup on home soil in June and July.

INPUT: Dozens more bodies were retrieved from the ruined eight-storey Rana Plaza on Sunday. Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster has sparked nationwide anger. A preliminary government investigation said this week vibrations from four generators on the upper floors triggered the collapse. Main Uddin Khandaker, head of a government inquiry team, said the generators started up after a power cut, sending powerful vibrations throughout the building, which - together with the vibration of thousands of sewing machines - triggered the collapse. The building had been constructed with weak materials, such as sub-standard steel rods, Mr Khandaker added, which meant it could not withstand the vibrations. The architect of the building has said it was designed to house shops and offices rather than factories or industrial equipment, and that three floors had been illegally added to the original building. On Sunday evening, police working at the site of the collapse in Savar, outside the capital Dhaka, put the death toll at 610. But they would not say how many more bodies were likely to be recovered from the area.

INPUT: Drivers said a safety device, known as "a dead man's handle", failed to activate and stop their trams. Tram Operations Ltd, which runs the line, said driver fatigue was monitored and controls were "fully functional". An interim report into November's crash suggested the tram was speeding and the driver may have "lost awareness". It found there was no emergency braking and the tram had been travelling at 46mph before it crashed in a 13mph zone, near the Sandilands Junction area of Croydon. However, a BBC investigation for the Victoria Derbyshire programme, has found that at least three trams have been recorded speeding on that same line since the derailment. One was travelling at 40mph in a 25mph zone. Another is understood to have been speeding near the crash site. Four current and former drivers have also admitted they have fallen asleep while driving a tram. Konrad Turner, who retired last year after driving trams in Croydon for 16 years, said he woke up 10 metres after passing the line's George Street stop, adding: "A person was very fortunate that I didn't run them over." Mr Turner said his tram's driver safety device - which is used on different types of tram across the UK and Europe - failed to work. Drivers have to apply 1.5lb of pressure on a lever and push it forward for the tram to accelerate. If pressure is not maintained, a safety device inside the lever should activate - sounding an alarm and then applying an emergency brake. There is no suggestion a problem with this device was responsible for the derailment at Sandilands. Guidance from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) safety regulator says the driver safety device should activate "in the event of driver collapse". Further guidance also states the device should be designed "so that it cannot be kept in the operating position other than by a vigilant tram driver". But six drivers said the device was not "fit for purpose". One said drivers were afraid to tell management about safety device failures because they feared being sacked over falling asleep. "You're asking somebody to come forward and admit to something that could cost them their job," he said, adding that he believed most drivers had fallen asleep at some point in the career. The BBC has uncovered three incidents in the past decade where drivers were incapacitated.</s>

INPUT: The Washington Post says it obtained a 1991 phone conversation between a PR man calling himself John Miller, but sounding like Mr Trump, and a reporter. Mr Trump said the voice on the tape did not belong to him. Reporters who covered his early career say they regularly spoke to a Trump spokesman sounding exactly like him. They would hear from the "spokesman", named as John Miller or John Baron, when asking to interview Mr Trump. Mr Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee after pushing out more than a dozen Republican rivals in the race for the White House. Traditional Republicans are warming to him to unify the party and beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Reacting to the Washington Post story on Friday, Mr Trump made his denial on the Today Show. "No, I don't know anything about it," he said. "You're telling me about it for the first time and it doesn't sound like my voice at all." "I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn't sound like me. "It was not me on the phone. And it doesn't sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone." Donald Trump is an unusual man who often behaves, shall we say, unconventionally. There's plenty of evidence for this, whether or not he made calls 25 years ago pretending to be his own publicist. Many New York reporters are convinced that this is a bona fide recording of the billionaire, and the fact that he's (allegedly) boasting about his dating prowess and celebrity socialising probably isn't the kind of story Mr Trump wants circulating as he tries to present himself as a more serious general election candidate. This is just the start, however. While Mr Trump has been in the public eye for decades, and New York tabloid scrutiny can be daunting, nothing compares to the glare of the presidential spotlight. Given that this is Mr Trump's first foray into public office, his past will receive extra scrutiny - with more revelations to come.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics. More specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy. The headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: "Consumption, great and small". What does this mean? Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households. Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time. The "great and small" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household. One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy. This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found. A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis. Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, "has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation". Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys. To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition. His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.

Lawrence Liddell, 59, from Hailesland Park, told BBC Scotland how he was still in shock after finding baby Charlotte. He said: "My friend and I saw a baby lying on the bench all wrapped up, waiting to be found, it looked like, because her blanket had been folded into a hood and tied with a bow. "It was a total shock and it all feels surreal even now. "We took her to the concierge, which was the nearest warm place, and called the police. "From what I could see the baby was well, she was lovingly wrapped and I just hope the mother is ok. "We looked around for the mum but we could not find her." Call for 'baby boxes' for abandoned newborns NHS Lothian also said tests have been carried out on baby Charlotte to rule out infection including Group B Strep. As a precaution Charlotte is being treated with antibiotics. Maria Wilson, NHS Lothian's chief midwife, said: "Baby Charlotte has had a good night and is doing well. "Our staff are continuing to care for her and we hope the mum and baby can be reunited. "I don't want the mum to feel afraid of contacting us because we treat everything confidentially.

Mr Ban describes his priorities as mobilising world leaders to deal with climate change, economic upheaval, pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water. In style, he prefers quiet diplomacy and sees himself as a bridge-builder, aiming to give voice to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthen the UN itself, which was dented when he took office by scandals over the UN oil-for-food programme in Iraq, and corrupt procurement. The South Korean diplomat took over from Kofi Annan at the UN in 2007. At that time he promised to push for peace in the Middle East and Sudan's Darfur region, and he prioritised climate change. The consensus on his first term was largely positive, despite the elusiveness of many of his goals. He wants to be remembered as the UN leader who presided over a global agreement on climate change. Born on 13 June 1944 in Chungju, Mr Ban served as South Korea's minister of foreign affairs and trade immediately before moving to the UN, at the culmination of a 37-year career as a diplomat. That career included the tough, high-wire act of negotiations with North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons. He is married with three children and three grandchildren. In the past, UN leaders have normally served two terms, although Egypt's Boutros Boutros-Ghali was ousted after just one term in 1996 by the United States, which felt he had performed poorly over the Balkan wars. Mr Ban is the second Asian to lead the UN. He has enjoyed broad support, but he has his critics, who point to his low-key style, lack of charisma, and failure to criticise human rights abuses in powerful countries, like China and Russia. At the end of his first term, however, he won praise for his commitment to climate change, nuclear disarmament and women's issues, as well as his strong backing of pro-democracy movements in North Africa and the Middle East. Mr Ban says he first dreamed of becoming a diplomat when as an 18-year-old student in 1962, he</s>

INPUT: The firm will rent voice and data capacity from two existing operators - Sprint and T-Mobile - and use existing wi-fi hotspots, rather than build new infrastructure from scratch. Initially, Project Fi will only be offered to Nexus 6 handset owners. Google Fiber, the firm's "ultra-fast" broadband service, is already seen as a disruptive force in the US telecoms market. It has been credited with encouraging Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their own customers speed boosts without higher prices. However, Fiber's roll-out involved Google buying infrastructure built by companies that had collapsed as well as laying its own fibre optic cables - giving it full control of the service. By contrast, one expert said running a mobile virtual network - which is dependent on rivals' equipment - might limit Project Fi's impact. "The example of MVNOs in the US and elsewhere suggests that it's hard for their operators to dramatically change the industry because of their nature," said Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. "But the past isn't always a guide to the future. "No-one would have thought that a handset manufacturer could transform the mobile industry by teaming up with one network - but that's what happened with Apple and AT&T when the iPhone launched. "And Google itself has repeatedly shown that it is capable of changing the direction of an industry by entering it."

"Sorry, no joy with Fabregas, I brought you Fellaini instead." A magnificent irony of transfer windows is that they were introduced in 2002-03 in part to stabilise the game.

Yet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States. But here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer.

INPUT: Leaked documents show that Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007. He did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later. He says no rules were broken and his wife did not benefit financially. The offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir in 2015. The leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson was granted a general power of attorney over Wintris - which gave him the power to manage the company "without any limitation". Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney. Court records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies. Mr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris. He resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full. If foreign investors had been repaid, it may have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris. But Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret. Mr Gunnlaugsson's spokesman said his policies had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants. "The prime minister's wife's losses on these bonds issued by the failed banks will amount to hundreds of millions of Kronur and the scope for recoveries is extremely small." The spokesman said Ms Palsdottir had always declared the assets to the tax authorities and that under the parliamentary rules Mr Gunnlaugsson did not have to declare an interest in Wintris. He said that joint share certificates in Wintris had been issued because the prime minister and his wife had a joint bank account.

While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of £1m and £20,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either £1m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to £2 but introduced the raffle with £20,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from £10 to £25. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because £2 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from £100,000 to £50,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from £1,500 to £1,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect. Because honestly, who can cope in their head with the difference between odds of 14 million to one and odds of 45 million to one? It's like comparing the odds of flipping a coin and getting 22 consecutive heads with the odds of getting 24. They both represent staggeringly unlikely events - it's just that in</s>

This is how his 364 days in charge went. After three days of speculation, the news was finally confirmed with a brief statement from the Basque club on Monday afternoon. "Real Sociedad would like to thank David Moyes and [his assistant, also departing] Billy McKinlay for the professional conduct, commitment and dedication which they showed during their roles in the running of the first team," the club said. "At the same time, we would like to wish them all the best in their future ventures, both professional and personal." The Scot leaves behind a team marooned near the foot of La Liga, and a limp performance in Friday night's 2-0 defeat against lowly Las Palmas was the final straw. The dismal display, as much as the result, forced club president Jokin Aperribay into holding crisis talks over the weekend. Aperribay did not want to rush into a hasty decision on the back of one bad game, but even after the dust had settled a couple of days later he still felt that a change was necessary.

The Local Development Plan (LDP) sets out where new houses can be built, based on a forecast that the population will grow by a quarter over 20 years. Cardiff council said the city was in "dire need" of the plan, to help it manage its growth. A final decision will be made by the local authority in the coming weeks, but it is expected to be rubber stamped by the council. Under the plan: The inspector has not given as much protection to the greenbelt on the edge of the city as a number of councillors and residents had campaigned for. The process has been long and controversial. Supporters say the expansion is needed to deal with the shortage of housing in the city, while opponents claim the city's infrastructure will not be able to cope. The plan is based on projections of a growth in the population from the 320,000 to nearly 400,000 over the period between 2006 and 2026. The last time Cardiff grew at this scale was at the height of the coal industry a century ago. Cardiff council cabinet member for planning and sustainability Ramesh Patel said the city was "in dire need" of the plan. "The last plan was approved 19 years ago and has led to insufficient land being made available for urgent housing needs," he said. "When the new plan is finally adopted at the end of January, we will ensure that developments in the city are managed effectively with new transport infrastructure, schools, health facilities and other community facilities. "The plan gives us the control to guide development and manage the growth of the city."</s>

The pictures of the spot reveal the intricate nature of its swirls which encompass a region bigger than Earth. Juno's instruments all acquired data during the pass which should now provide fresh insight on the storm. It has been a particularly long-lived feature on Jupiter, but there is evidence that the 16,350-km-wide oval has actually been shrinking of late. "For hundreds of years scientists have been observing, wondering and theorising about Jupiter's Great Red Spot," Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a Nasa statement. "Now we have the best pictures ever of this iconic storm. It will take us some time to analyse all the data from not only JunoCam, but Juno’s eight science instruments, to shed some new light on the past, present and future of the Great Red Spot." Scientists describe the storm as something similar to a hurricane - but there are significant differences between that kind of storm on Earth and what we see at Jupiter. Many behaviours are not the same. For example, hurricanes on Earth quickly lose energy when they leave the ocean surface and pass over land - but on Jupiter, there is no land. Indeed, researchers are not even sure there exists any kind of hard surface under the planet's clouds. This could be an explanation for why the spot has persisted for centuries. But Juno hopes to resolve such puzzles. It has the instrumentation to determine the precise chemical composition of the oval's clouds, to sense their temperature and structure, and to measure how deep they go. There is a suspicion that the spot has very deep roots. Jonathan Nichols, a British science team-member from the University of Leicester, marvelled at the new pictures. "These images are stunning, and reveal Jupiter's Great Red Spot in all its glory," he told BBC News. "From the three swirls inside the deep red core to the waves and vortices orbiting it, the images reveal the power and chaos of this iconic storm. "The light and dark shades reveal the wind flow in the spot and potentially the 3D structure of the cloud decks.

"He was an exceptional talent both behind the camera and editing the work of others and even in the grimmest circumstances he always made sure to live life to the fullest," Lyon said. "He will be sorely missed by scores of colleagues, especially that reduced group with whom he covered conflict, particularly the Vietnam generation." Speaking to the BBC in 2007, Faas described his job in simple terms. "I tried to be in the newspapers every day, to beat the opposition with better photos. I didn't try to do anything grandiose. The photos were used and published and asked for, becuase Vietnam was on the front pages year after year after. "I lived from day to day, from event to event. It was a perfect story for an agency photographer." He began his career covering conflicts in 1960, four years after joining the Associated Press (AP). He worked in what was then Zaire, and in Algeria, before relocating to Vietnam, where he won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Accepting the award, he said he aimed to "record the suffering, the emotions and the sacrifices of both Americans and Vietnamese in... this little bloodstained country so far away," AP said. He had a front row view of much of that suffering.
